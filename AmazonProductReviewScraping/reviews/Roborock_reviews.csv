5.0 out of 5 stars,BEST ROB VAC (in this price range),¬†I purchased the Roborock E4 over a month ago.
4.0 out of 5 stars,A True LIFE SAVER!!!!,"I've only noticed a few minor issues with this vacuum. Sometimes it doesn't do the entire area and I have to run it a 2nd time, but it gets it all then. Haven't figured out why it does this yet. I have a area rug and it doesn't even slow it down, my husband thinks it does a better job on the rug than the hardwood floors!! The bin is large enough to hold everything left on the floor from 3 large dogs, 3 adults, 2 kids and multiple people coming and going. As I'm in a wheelchair this thing is a LIFE SAVER for me!!!! I also ordered the ""mop"" setup and will be trying it out soon. I have to admit I caught this on sale for 100 off but this machine is worth the full price to me!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great value robot vac,"¬†We have had this little vac for almost two months and I thought it was time for a review. I‚Äôll start off by saying it isn‚Äôt a roomba and you can definitely tell that by some of its quirky motions, the biggest being that our carpet is a little longer and causes it to ‚Äúsee‚Äù an object and clean around it. I addressed this with customer service and they were prompt with replies and helpful to let me know it was an issue with our carpet length. Overall though even with that issue it still clean our carpet thoroughly every time, just takes a bit longer than expected. It has no issue making nice lines in the carpet and picks up a full bin every time. We have two dogs that shed and three young kids so we run it daily. Overall I‚Äôm very happy with this purchase and hopefully it will hold up for quite some time. It does an okay job mapping the house but without Lidar control this was expected. We don‚Äôt review many items but I wanted to let anyone on the fence with this unit know it‚Äôs worth the purchase! Also I‚Äôll add that it regularly finishes a room then goes to the next doorway to start another and have only had it not make it to the dock a couple times when going to recharge."
5.0 out of 5 stars,My new helper,"First of all, I used to be a person who saw a robot vacuum's being not worth it. There are a couple of reasons for this like price and overall cleaning. That was the case until I found this little bot, for only $250 you get a great bot."
1.0 out of 5 stars,Gets stuck on EVERYTHING. Constant supervision required. Disappointing...,"¬†Grabbed this on Cyber Monday and was really excited for the first cleaning session. Got it set up pretty easily in the app and then let it go to work. I walked away and moments later I heard a loud grinding noise, followed by several notification alarms on my phone. The Roborock had gotten stuck on the threshold of my hardwood floor doorway and couldn't figure out how to simply back up or turn around. I manually repositioned him and walked away as he resumed cleaning, but several minutes later I heard an even louder grinding noise followed by another notification on my phone. The Roborock had rolled into my bathroom rug and got stuck. My bathroom rug has rubber anti-slide grips underneath, so I was kind of disappointed that the Roborock couldn't manage to roll into the rug without lifting it off the ground and shoving it across the floor."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Powerful suction and good mapping,"The robot suction power is great, it cleans really well and doesn't scatter debris around. it will also automatically increase suction to high once detect carpet and will clean until the battery reach low level then go back to the dock and recharge to resume cleaning from the same spot it finished. It's accuracy is really good as long as it was not manually interrupted or placed in different spot."
3.0 out of 5 stars,Very impressed how the robot cleans adequately,"I just bought the Roborock E4 3 weeks ago. I was very skeptical at first on how a vacuum robot could clean and vacuum the hard floors and carpets in my home. We have 3 rabbits, so it means a lot of small hay left on the floors and carpets and some dry rabbit poops around the litter. That means I have to vacuum 3-4 times a week the whole house and this is time consuming. I first tested the robot downstairs. I was surprised on how it handled the rabbits fur balls. I was watching it go and it really covered the whole floor where it could go and even the edges. I then brought it back upstairs in the kitchen where there were rabbits fur balls, some toast crumbs (from breakfast) and some sand (coming from shoes when going in and out). It was the best time to test it and see if it vacuumed all the small debris. I started it and went downstairs. After 26 min, it was finished as I got the notification. I went upstairs and at my surprise, everything was gone, cleaned. The last test I performed was to put the robot in the rabbits room where there's a carpet. There were a lot of small hay on the carpet and some rabbit poops. This was the ultimate test. After 20 min, the robot was done with the cleaning so I went to look and there were no more poops and just some hay left on the carpet. That's to say that I've got a Shark Rocket vacuum and I have to pass more than once on the carpet so all the hay is vacuum so I can say that the Roborock E4 does a similar job. Looking at the robot, it goes in a Z shape pattern and knows where it's been and where to go. It's not a random pattern like the cheaper robots. Only one concern. When the robot cleans the edges, the side brush speeds up and sometimes, instead of throwing the debris in front of the robot so it can vacuum those debris, it throws the debris too far towards the center of the room. Since the robot starts with the center of the room and finishes with the edges, some debris that were thrown in the middle are not vacuum and since the robot finishes with the edges, it goes back to the charging station after having done the edges, leaving some debris in the center. That's why I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5. In all, I'm very satisfied with that vacuum robot and at this price, it does a good job with its double gyroscope and OpticEye system."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Move cords out of the way and let it do it‚Äôs job!,It picks up so much from my dog that I thought was clean... He shakes causing hair floating in the air and settles on the floors. I wish I had bought one years ago!! Love it! üòä
5.0 out of 5 stars,It is better than we ever  thought it could be.,"We just love this robot. We have a dog and lots of carpet and it works like a dream We vacumned the carpet before we used the Robot. We had to empty the Robot four times, even though it had just been vacumned. We love that it goes under the couch and chairs---no need to move anything, Works great on our hard wood floors too."
5.0 out of 5 stars,FLEXING MUSCLES...My New Cleaning Man Rocks,"After over 20 hours of research and reviews, I could not gave been more pleased going with Roborock E4 as my very first robot vacuum. Paid about $170 out the door after applying $75 reward points, $110 coupon on top of cyber sale price."
5.0 out of 5 stars,It works well getting pet hair up,It works well for cat hair and dog hair. I'm happy with my vacuum
5.0 out of 5 stars,Really Worth the Money!,"Looks prettier than the picture shows, the matte black design looks very cool."
4.0 out of 5 stars,E4 Works Well with Limitations,"This review is long, but if you‚Äôll take the time to read it, I think you‚Äôll find a lot of useful information about the Roborock E4. It is a good alternative both in price and performance to the random navigation robot vacuums, which just bounce around. Budget robots feature random navigation as do the less expensive models of Shark and Roomba. The E4 uses internal navigation to move around your home leaving straight lines and covering 99% of a room."
3.0 out of 5 stars,Great vacuum. Terrible app,"I wanted to love this vacuum. It works great. After several attempts, the device finally connected to wifi, but then it will drop from wifi periodically and then it takes several attempts to reconnect. Roborock customer service responds pretty quickly, but by email only. There is no customer service phone number. Sadly, I have to return the vacuum. I don't have the time to repeatedly attempt to reconnect to wifi."
1.0 out of 5 stars,Roborock E4,"This product cleans okay but it has issues. I bought it July 28, 2020 and it has never been able to dock by itself. It will look all over the house for the dock and be within 6 foot of it and still not find it. I have to pick it up and sit it down within a foot of the dock. Last month for over two weeks it would not connect to the app and it finally started connecting again and updated. Last week it has started running against the wall or any object and it will spin around and around in circles and then give an error 8. I can pick it up and move it then start it again and it will finish cleaning. I have cleaned everything on the vacuum that can be cleaned. I really regret buying this, it should last longer than 3 months."
4.0 out of 5 stars,One Week In,"Purchased the E4 just over a week ago and have used it every day. It has worked great so far and I have no complaints. The first time I ran it, I followed it as it cleaned the entire house so I could locate trouble spots. I Had to adjust a few things to keep the sensor on top of the machine from causing it to get stuck. Uneven floors would allow it to move under furniture at one point, but then not have the clearance to exit at a different point. Transitions seamlessly from wood to tile to area rugs. Although it does not like really small light weight area rugs. Then again, no vacuum does so not really a big issue for me. It sometimes will clean the same area twice, but I think that has more to do with the cats and dogs taking issues with it and knocking it off course. Which brings up my favorite part of this machine. It slows down when it senses a obstacle in front of it, which in our case is usually our older slower moving cat. Overall very pleased so far. 1600 sq ft floor, all hardwood and tile with 3 dogs and 4 cats."
3.0 out of 5 stars,Good Cleaner If You Can Get It To Work Correctly,"I like the cleaning power of this vacuum it does a good job of suctioning things up. I‚Äôve had a few problems with it that I‚Äôve not been able to solve. I‚Äôve reached out to Roborock customer service several times and had no reply so just having to use it the way it is. Within two runs, my vacuum has been covered in scuffs, scratches, and paint. It runs into everything and doesn‚Äôt stop. It just keeps pounding itself into it which has caused the vacuum to look terrible. Nearly every time the vacuum runs, I have to chase it down when it‚Äôs done cleaning to take it back to its base. It will run until it dies looking for the base. It‚Äôs not blocked by a lot of things or difficult to reach. The vacuum goes to three different rooms looking for it‚Äôs base but not the room the base is in. The vacuum also decides what rooms it wants to clean that time. Some runs, it will completely ignore a room. It‚Äôll take five more runs to get it to go into that room. Lastly, I‚Äôve been unable to get the app to do the things the listing here says it will. I have been unable since purchase to make (or get the vacuum) to create a map. The app disconnects from the vacuum constantly so I don‚Äôt even use it at this point. If these issues were worked out, this would be a great vacuum."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Reliability and technically advanced unit,"Love this Roborock E4 , I‚Äôll be honest I‚Äôm sort of embarrassed showing the picture that I have posted. But I wanted to show you how well it actually works. I have two cats and a dog and we vacuum every day. I have area rugs and a tiled floor. I know, by the picture you wouldn‚Äôt think so, LOL. But I must admit the robot got into areas that we do not normally vacuum, like under the sofas, wall units ,beds and cabinets and produced what you see in the Photo. I love the fact that it actually increases the suction power when it goes over the rugs and reduces power when it goes back onto the tiles. Unlike other robots it doesn‚Äôt blow light items or hair around the floor from It‚Äôs exhaust , it‚Äôs designed with a diffuser where the air comes out of. I also like the fact that it connects to Alexa. It also has the option of mopping as well, But I haven‚Äôt used this feature as of yet. I had the shark robot vacuum which worked well but not as well as this one. But I will warn you if you have carpeting with black borders or just black carpeting it will avoid the carpet thinking it‚Äôs either an edge that it can fall off or the stairs. I have a Carpet with black borders and I was able to override the cliff sensors by applying white paper over the four sensors that it has. But keep in mind that I live in a single level home. If you have a multi level home I would not recommend covering the cliff sensors with white paper. I love this vacuum and highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a high end budget vacuum cleaner that is extremely reliable and has mapping capabilities as well. I paid $239 and it‚Äôs worth every penny. I am very happy with the purchase!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,Destroys baseboards and furniture,"I have had this vacuum for a few months now and had it running every morning. As a vacuum it does a decent job. The navigation is ok, better than the simpler vacuums since it mostly does straight lines but not as good as the vacuums with LIDAR navigation."
1.0 out of 5 stars,Spend the money on a better system,"Do not go for this one, the price is tempting, until it constantly gets stuck and you have to baby it. recently i have been finding gears from the vacuum falling off after only a month of use."
2.0 out of 5 stars,Does not work on carpet.,¬†For whatever reason this will not work on carpet. I‚Äôve tried 6+ times in my basement with zero luck. It moves around the same area for about 5 minuets and gives an error saying objects in the way. Will be sending back unless this is resolved.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Thing is great!,"Had this for about a week now, and I'm really impressed with it. It has great suction, and actually gets in spots we have to work more to get. I was amazed how much this thing was cleaning up each day. The app is easy to use and lets you setup a schedule, shows you a cleaning map, etc. Very happy with it so far!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,Nope...don't get this,"I purchased this after LOVING the E35 so much. From my online research, the E4 was pretty identical except that it didn't come with the mop function, which I didn't need for upstairs since it's almost all carpet. I was SO excited when this came...set it up and charged it immediately. I've run it upstairs on low pile carpeting about 4 or 5 times now and it is absolutely HORRIBLE! The noise level is fine, not too loud at all. But it doesn't pick up anything hardly at all! Not even paper hole punch circles, not thread pieces, not random pieces of small lint/papers/debris. You can see the marks in the carpet from where it was, but the debris is literally still there. It just goes right over it and leaves it there. I'm not sure if they would take it back after it being used 4 -5 times, but I deeply regret having purchased this and wish I would have just bought another E35. It sucks at sucking! :("
1.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn‚Äôt work.,It doesn‚Äôt work. The app repeatedly freezes and doesn‚Äôt allow anything to initialize. There is no ability to communicate. I could upload a video here of the worthless thing tentatively and repeatedly going over about three feet in the middle of an open room without touching either side of the wall or hitting anything on a regular carpet. Then it goes to sleep. It hasn‚Äôt managed to do one single empty room.
4.0 out of 5 stars,It Came Used and Dirty/Second One is Great,"As soon as I opened the shipping box, I could tell the original seal had been broken. Inside, the vacuum itself and all the separate parts were dirty. I'm pretty upset to think dirt, germs, and possibly critters (bedbugs, roaches) could have hitched a ride into my house. I've asked for a new replacement, but if the next one comes in the same condition, I'll be pretty peeved. This exact circumstance was mentioned in a prior review, so I guess it's an Amazon thing that happens from time to time."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Compared to iRobot i7, this is about 75% as good at a quarter of the price.","I have both this and the Roomba i7. These are both amazing machines. I had a 5 year old roomba and wow, the new gen has come a long way!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Should have bought this years ago!  Love it!,EDIT AFTER 6 OR 7 WEEKS OF USE:
2.0 out of 5 stars,I regret this purchase,"This review is mainly regarding the phone application for the Roborock E4. The vacuum itself does a decent job. It initially liked to beach itself on my shag rug, but thankfully it somehow figured out the rug and now avoids it. The vacuum also likes to get stuck in a corner in my bedroom and keep on the same path until I move it. It‚Äôs a bit annoying but that area is now the cleanest corner in the room."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Best model I‚Äôve tried so far,"I have tried comparable models from Deebot, Roomba 600 series, MooSoo & Kyvol. I can honestly say that the Roborock has the most, and best, features. While the Roomba was definitely best at raising the nap of the carpet, it was very limited on the extra functions, at least for the ‚Äúunder $700 models.‚Äù"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Best investment I‚Äôve ever made!,"¬†Love having this robot vacuum!!! This has made my life so much easier and less stressful. I live with two roommates and my level of cleanliness is a lot higher than theirs, so instead of stressing over the fact that there‚Äôs crumbs all over the floor after it was just cleaned, I just turn on Fred (we named him) and I come back to a clean kitchen and living room!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Best thing ever!!!,"¬†I got this robot vacuum when it was a ‚Äúdeal of the day‚Äù on amazon. I got it for a great price! After purchasing, I ALMOST canceled my order because I thought the price was too good to be true and it was going to be crap and I wasted my money...but after doing some research, I thought ok, I‚Äôm going to give it a try. I AM COMPLETELY IMPRESSED!!! I have 2 shedding dogs (one being a pure bred husky), a cat, and 2 kids. This little vacuum has saved my sanity!! It picks up SOOOO much! The video I posted was after I vacuumed with my kerby vacuum just a couple hours before!! I definitely recommend this vacuum! Best decision I made!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"MMI, or Lack Thereof -- One Awesome Disappointment","I purchased this robot vacuum, the Roborock E4, largely on the basis of it rated suction value and the ""Outstanding"" reviews appearing on these pages., I have had the vacuum for about 3 hours, most of which time was spent in setting up the Mi Home app, Alexa, and the vacuum. What a disappointment. There is very little, if any, coordination between or integration of the users manual, the Hi Hone app, and Alexa. Alexa is understandable, but there is no excuse for the lack of integration of the Roborock E4 and the Mi Home app. The instructions in the users manual are brief, cryptic, and unsatisfactory for any normal human. The Hi Home app likewise is cryptic, hard to read, and hard to follow. The user interface is totally inadequate. I wonder if any of the vacuum developers have even bothered to try to use this app with this vacuum. By dint of perserverance I did connect the vacuum to my Wi-Fi network and get the vacuum to connect with the dock. I also sent the vacuum on its first cleaning mission. However, forget about programming the machine and the Mi Home app to operate within a given area, such as the living room, or a bedroom. There does not appear to any provision in the MI Home app to do that. I don't know where to glowing reviews for this vacuum originated. Perhaps the reviewers purchased a different vacuum then I did or they have not tried anything other that manually operating the vacuum. I have yet to try this vacuum as a vacuum. Perhaps my opinion will change once I have done so. Right now, the Roborock E4, Mi Home app, and Alexa combined are "" One Awesome Disappointment."""
5.0 out of 5 stars,Large Dust Bin,"The first thing I noticed about this vacuum is the large dust bin. See in my picture next to the can of Pledge. After running the robot vacuum on a regularly vacuumed carpet it picked up a good amount of embedded dust and dirt. This robot does not have mapping or no-go lines like some of the higher-level models, but I think this is reflected in the pricing. Overall I am happy with this vacuum and will use it to keep my pool table chaulk free."
3.0 out of 5 stars,Sometimes she gets lost,"We bought two of the Roborock 4's. One upstairs and one down. They vacuum really well and we have a Great Pyrenees anda St Bernard so hair in our house is amazing, even though I brush them. These vacuums keep up with the hair very well. The only problem we have had is they sometimes get lost when going home. I bought my son one Roborock 6 and a 4 for his new house. He loved the 6, super fast and never gets lost. We returned the 4 and bought another 6 for him. The highlight of the Roborock is the dusbin can be thoroughly cleaned. I feel good about that. We use them daily and the house has no dog hair. Super job."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Everything is said it was.  Very pleased with my purchase!!!,"I bought this thing to hopefully help with the massive amount of dog hair my two labs shed on a daily basis. It can get overwhelming at times. I could make a new dog with the hair every other day. So I googled top rated robot vacuums for pet hair and this machine came up. The price was good and the reviews were good. The set up was very simple, you down load an app, register it, then connect to the wifi, maybe 10 minutes total, then let it charge up. Well 2 days in and I am very pleased. I have to empty the tray several times during its cleaning session but that isn't any problem and was to be expected. It have about 1800 sq feet of tile flooring that it cleaned very well. I kept the bedroom doors closed that have carpeting, so I can't speak for how it would handle the rooms, but it cleans the few throw rugs that I have strewn throughout the house with ease. No more sweeping for me, this thing kicks butt so far. Oh and its pretty quiet as well. I just let it run as I watched TV and it did its thing. I would definitely purchase again if need be. If you have pets or kids, I don't think you will be disappointed with your purchase."
3.0 out of 5 stars,Affordable and does great...UNTIL,"I live in a small townhouse with a cat and a golden retriever, so fur is all over the house. Not to mention the dirt that we track inside from our walks. Every morning, I run the vacuum and it picks up and all the loose fur, not to mention the litter my cat scatters everywhere. I even run it one more time in the evening to pick up the dirt brought in during the day. It allows me to get other things down while I know the floors are getting cleaned. The battery life has been great."
4.0 out of 5 stars,Very Impressive,"I am going to preface this review by saying that I did not expect this vacuum/mop to be as effective as my regular vacuum or floor cleaner and it is not. However, I am quite impressed with this little guy. As many others stated in their reviews, I cancelled my cleaning service due to covid and I admit, I wasn't that good at cleaning my carpets and floors as often as I should. I took that money I saved by not having a cleaning service and bought myself ""Geoffrey"" (thanks for the name, Fresh Prince). I was amazed at how much dirt ""Geoffrey"" sucked up after 1 pass. While he did miss a few spots, he was able to get to areas I cannot reach with my upright vacuum, such as under the bed. The reason I took 1 star off was for the mopping. I attempted to mop with the provided mopping pad but all I got was a wet pad, no dirt. I stuck a thicker wet mop pad using velcro and let it go for another pass. I was amazed how much dirt I was on the pad following the 2nd round. I don't think the mop pad is thick enough to truly ""mop"" the floor. Small detail but I wanted to mention it to make others aware. In summary, I would highly recommend this machine!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,See how it holds up,Bought it to help with dog hair and foot prints on floor... first one lost drive wheel in 3 days... was replaced by Amazon... just started new one yesterday will see how it holds up vs the other robot upstairs thats 3 or 4 years old now and still running...
1.0 out of 5 stars,After 3 months,"It‚Äôs really good for the price. Really impressed but after a month of using it, it started completely missing rooms. Some days it would skip my room and some days it would skip my entire HUGE hallway. It‚Äôs pretty annoying having to start is all over again."
1.0 out of 5 stars,WiFi wouldn‚Äôt connect,The product seemed a decent quality but I tried every conceivable thing to get it to connect to Wi-Fi and it was unsuccessful. Many others have had the same problem so should‚Äôve listened to those reviews.
1.0 out of 5 stars,Mop function is useless if you have any rugs on the floor,This product should not be sold. If you have a area rug on your floor it's useless.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great value,"If you are on the market for a robot vacuum, I can highly recommend the Roborock E4!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,Does NOT have mapping,The description states this vacuum has mapping and even shows the app with mapping. This vacuum does NOT have mapping using the software mentioned in the instructions. We returned a different brand of vacuum that had mapping and it stopped working. So we returned it and specifically purchased this vacuum to try another brand with mapping. Don't buy this one. False advertisement. Also the instructions talk about wet mopping. This device also does not have wet mopping.
5.0 out of 5 stars,So close! Perfected by service.,5/22/2020 Update:
3.0 out of 5 stars,Not as effective as I hoped.,Tried it for 3 days. Does an good job with vacuuming. But has consistently missed 2 full bedrooms and one half of another bedroom. There is no way to make it go to those rooms. Disappointed.
1.0 out of 5 stars,Buyer beware - cheap IS cheap,"We have had this a couple of months and had to return it. If you have to hand vacuum all the places this thing misses, then why run it? I did one room and then ran my dyson upright to see what it missed and even though it picked up some, it still left enough for half a container on my dyson. It blows some debris out of its reach and then doesn‚Äôt go back to clean that. I had a deboot, that lasted for 3 years under heavy use, and it was great until my son broke it. This thing never mapped or went in a straight line, just went off diagonally wherever. I bit the bullet and bought a roomba for more suction power and overall better reviews, even from close friends. Just remember, you get what you pay for in this instance."
3.0 out of 5 stars,Nice device/Alexa and App seem like false advertising,"We really like our Roborock vacuum. It cleans our downstairs while we sleep today. It covers about a thousand square feet in 2 hours or so. Does a great job on carpet and hardwood, doesn‚Äôt scuff anything, and cleans up pet hair from 2 dogs and 2 cats. We only do spot cleaning nowadays and it‚Äôs nice: 1 less thing to do."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Buy a robot vacuum already!,The robot vacuum post that you didn't know you needed! TL;DR
3.0 out of 5 stars,"Noisy, useless app","This cleaner is advertised to have app supported remote control. App (on the Android) is completely useless. It wants access to location (considering this is an app from China, we will pass). What is the point of location services? Ridiculous. All the app needs to do is connect to the vacuum that is in our house, not somewhere across the world, so why location services? Not giving it full access to the phone means limited functionality? That's fine, except that it will not connect to our robot at all. So effectively, WIFI is a waste of battery, and the advertised WIFI/APP is something that the vendor should take out of the cost as it's flat out does not work."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Loud, app is absolutely novice, but does a surprisingly good job of trouble-free cleaning",Was on the verge of returning this. First impression was the utterly novice garbage app with Chinese characters everywhere. I'm guessing roborock paid bottom dollar for software 'talent' and passed the savings on? Can't integrate with Alexa because the app is gibberish. Zero stars on that count.
2.0 out of 5 stars,Works fine but App is worthless,I waited a long time to get a new robo vacuum and thought this sounded great based on reviews. Sure enough it works great but DO NOT believe them about the app. I is a total waste of space on my phone and does not work at all. Absolutely useless. You can still get some benefit from this if you're willing to manually start it. But again DO NOT believe that you'll be able to control it with the app. It absolutely does not work.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent robot vaccuum & mop at an affordable price. I'm astonished honestly.,"Best purchase possibly ever or at least since my Dyson purchase. I am astonished at how well this little guy cleans up everything. We have predominantly hardwood floors throughout our home but many area rugs a dog and two bunnies that can create quite a mess. Not to mention the 3 girls, one of which rides horses and brings home all sorts of dirt,dust and fur and a husband who loves to cook, tinker and leave messes everywhere because he's too busy creating and thinking, all of which I am ok with but I also work a lot and run my own business. So not a lot of time for cleaning honestly. We have it set on a cleaning schedule at night while were sleeping. I have it run nightly to clean up the day's messes. I've noticed it has also significantly cut down on the amount of dust our home/we produces likely improving the overall air quality in the home. The mop feature works very well and I run that every other night just to keep things tidy overall. I still do a deep clean once a month myself but have noticed a great improvement overall in our floors cleanliness. I would suggest buying more mop cloths if you end up using this feature as much as I do. With kids you will want to use it. It really does a good job mopping surprisingly. I'm honestly shocked."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good price and features, not so good on medium pile carpet",Overall a very good product. I bought this model because it goes in straight lines to clean and not in a random pattern. It will map your house using its optic eye which is why there is only one side brush. And I believe if it runs out of battery it will recharge and resume where it left off. My house is too small so it always finishes at around 60% battery.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it!,I run this robot daily and sometimes twice daily if the dogs have tracked dirt in or out. It‚Äôs unbelievable how much dirt it picks up daily-mostly dog hair and dander. It has completely changed the way I clean. I run a broom behind doors and in some corners about once a week and the robot does the rest. The mopping feature cleans the dog prints and small spots. I put hot water in the reservoir to start. I leave rugs in place even when using the mop feature. It‚Äôs such a small amount of moisture that it has not had any impact on the area rugs. I cannot speak for carpet because I have none. The app is reassuring because it shows the cleaning path after each cleaning session so I know it has not missed a room like my old Roomba used to do. I put it in gentle mode when I want the robot to be nearly silent while cleaning but otherwise I use the balanced mode for faster cleaning. The battery lasts for the entire cleaning unless I put it in turbo mode for a faster cleaning. I use the robot for the first floor which is about 1800 sf. It occasionally wedges itself under a kitchen cabinets but not every time. I have to close the front door during cleaning to keep its wheels from getting suspended. I tell everyone about this vacuum because I like it so much.
4.0 out of 5 stars,of the 5 different robot vacuums I've had these are my favorite!,"I've had 2 different roborock models, 2 different eufy models and the irobot 675. my Roomba was amazing. had it about 3 years and it still runs like new. biggest thing I didn't like about it was that it got stuck constantly and about once a week didn't return to it's base. the eufy models had this problem as well. both brands get long female hair stuck in the brush like crazy though as well! my gf has really long hair and the roborock models do a great job of not getting tons of hair stuck in the brush. I went with the roborock E40s overall because of the lack of maintenance they require. I have 3 levels, one bot on each level. I have a small dog sitting business and even when I'm fully booked with long hair dogs these can go easily 3 days without having to even think about them. you can tell when brushing out the filter that it does a great job of catching fine particles and the filter can even be rinsed well with warm water."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"Quit charging, connection problems",Bought this just a couple months ago. It never did connect to my phone or WiFi and I contacted them but did not want to deal with it so I just let that slide and would press start on the device every morning as there is not a remote. It suctions well and cleans in rows instead of bouncing around which is great but has now quit charging. I have cleaned it and tried many things to get it to charge fully. When I load it onto the dock it will say charging and even look like it‚Äôs charging but when I come back to try to use it it says error 12 not enough battery. Maybe mine is just defective I don‚Äôt know but I would have loved it if it would have ever connected to my internet and would still love it if it would just charge.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Best mid level Robot...HANDS DOWN!,"First use and I very happy with my choice. I looked for the best mid level vacuum for weeks, reading and watching reviews. I always ended up back at the E4. I had concerns over the spare parts shortage but I ordered a OEM roller brush with the vacuum. I also ordered additional parts directly from China, off ‚ÄúAbay‚Äù. It is replacing a old, worn out ECOVACS Deebot M81. I wanted another ecovacs because mine has been through a lot and it still works, however ecovacs doesn‚Äôt have any mid level bots to compete with the E4. I wanted something with navigation without breaking the bank. This is it!!! The application is fine, people are complaining that the application setup is hard to do, absolutely untrue. Just make sure you phone is connected to the same 2.4ghz WiFi that you choose in the app. Application has much more to offer than the ecovacs app. The bot talks to you which seems very professional. My entire floor is hardwood and watching it clean in straight lines and when is pauses to think about where to go is amazing. Just like the big money lazer bots. I do not know the durability or customer service aspects at this time but I do believe it is the right choice for the money. The roomba E5 was another option but the roborock wins in all categories. Huge battery, huge dustbin, navigation, price. For the 250-300$ range I do believe this is top dog."
1.0 out of 5 stars,This vacuum is terrible,This vacuum is terrible. Goes right over small pieces of dirt that should be easily suctioned up and leaves the dirt behind. Battery seems to last less than an hour. Doesn‚Äôt clean at all. I didn‚Äôt open it until a few months after purchasing and what a mistake that was!!
5.0 out of 5 stars,Fantastic and worth the money!,"Just to give you some background, I got this because I have a cat and dog (both shirt hair) who shed like it's their mission in life. My husband also is unfortunate enough to be allergic to pet hair and me sweeping daily wasn't enough so I decided maybe its time for some help. He had mentioned getting a Roomba in the past but he's also hella booshy and seems to think we have this kinda money. I happened to come across some money I could spent and, as if it were meant to be, this little buddy was on a flash sale! I bought it without a second thought (after doing research)."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Way better than a Roomba!,"I have both this product and a Roomba... Up against each other, the Roborock wins hands down. It doesn't get stuck as much, it doesn't get hair tangled in it as easily, the sweeper is nylon so it's fantastic for hardwood floors, it learns the layout of the house faster... The list could go on. I have two long haired, double-coated dogs and this robot vacuum keeps up in a 1500 sq ft house! I do have to run it daily and I sweep/mop at least once a week, but it cuts down on the time I spend cleaning tremendously! It does great on carpet and hardwood floors. I haven't used the mop function so I can't speak to that... It does tend to rearrange my smaller rugs, but I just have to remember to pick them up before I run the Roborock."
4.0 out of 5 stars,Does a decent job for the price,We like it because we have to vacuum every day to keep the dog hair to a minimum and this device takes the drudgery out of it. The dogs are fascinated by it and like to follow it around.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great product! Good suction, smart and thorough.","I love the Robo rock. I have looked at every brand and every review. The roomba doesn‚Äôt have consistent reviews for the price. This robo rock is amazing. It cleans well. It seems smart: it follows a pattern, it figures out how to get out of a pickle, can identity to stay away from stairs, etc. I downloaded the recommended app and can make it clean from my phone. The base is on my main floor, but I needed to clean upstairs. No problem. I just picked him up and pressed start. When I figured he did everything, I took him back downstairs. I‚Äôm so incredibly happy with this purchase. I bought this brand based on a friend‚Äôs recommendation (he is as picky as I am about buying these electronics). The price after the applied coupon was around $200 and that seems like a bargain based on the quality of work this robot puts in. My advice to everyone- take care of it. Maintain it like it says in the manual. It‚Äôs so easy to dispense the tray and clean out the rotating brush. Be good to it and I bet it‚Äôll be good to you."
3.0 out of 5 stars,Read this if you're having problems connecting the E4 to your WIFI,"I have had the Roborock E4 in my possession for 6 hours, long enough to vacuum the first floor of my home and it's worked flawlessly during it's maiden voyage around the corners and crevices of my home. On first impression, it appears to be better engineered and out-performs my old $570 Neato D4 which died 4 days short of its 3rd birthday."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Can't believe I lived without this machine!,When I first opened the box & looked this robot over I was very skeptical...it looked very similar to my Roomba - it would be getting stuck every night in the exact same spots. The dust bin looked like I'll never be able to get all of the dirt out because of the lip. The mop attachment is so small I figured I would be spending my day refilling it. BUT!!! I wouldn't trade this machine for anything!
2.0 out of 5 stars,Keep looking -  wouldn't be my first choice,"¬†I had reviewed this product previously before making it my primary robot vac. Since, I've come to learn that this machine lacks in so many ways. However, I'll start with the positives, which are just a few. I like how it follows a continuous pattern rather than zigzagging through the house. It has a great battery life. And, the reason I purchased it, was the mopping option. Now calling it mopping is a far stretch of the imagination, but it does allow you to run a wet cloth across the floors while also vacuuming. This is a nice feature with all hard floors. What I don't like: It does not pick up near the amount of debris as my other robot and there have been times that I look at my floor after running it that it looks untouched. I detest the just cup. It doesn't have a full opening on any side so the dust never completely empties. It's like one of those maze games to move it in the right direction to get it all emptied. I also have a huge issue with this robot getting stuck at the threshold. My other robot powers over everything - this one barely makes it over and sometimes does not. I contacted customer service to inquire, I suspected I may have a defective machine. I was told to clean the wheels which I did and just a few cleanings afterwards the problem began again. Then I was told to use a a mat at the threshold. When I told them I did not want a mat I was simply told to reset the vac. At that point I decided it wasn't worth it to continue to interact with customer service and my best move would be to advise other buyers to beware. I definitely wouldn't purchase this vac again, not even to have the wet pad/mop feature and I strongly urge you to keep looking."
5.0 out of 5 stars,More Pros Than Cons,"Easy setup. Great on getting pet fur off carpets and floors. Keeps dusty dirt off floors. Easy to maintain (cleaning sensors, emptying dust bin, cleaning brushes). Due to the low clearance of my kitchen cabinets, it does get briefly stuck each time it's used - the top of the unit has some awful scratches from that. Hopefully, future models will be scratch-resistant. I have experienced Wi-Fi connection issues but, I just repeat the Wi-Fi setup and it works again. I would buy this again. Yes, I would recommend this product."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Five-star product, a five star price",The E4 does all of these things well:
5.0 out of 5 stars,Can't believe this little vaccum can handle the dog hair! IT DOES!,"This is possibly the BEST money I have ever spent in my entire life! I have 2 German Shepherds. The saying with Shepherds is, ""They only shed twice a year but both times lasts 6 months""! Truer words were never spoken! Keeping ahead of the hair is a nearly impossible task. I use to swiffer 2-3 times a day and vacuum every other day. Plus run around with a wisk broom and dust pan for the hair that escaped the swiffer and vacuum. With the Robovac I pick the dog's beds up beofre I go to work (the dogs go with me daily) and once I'm at work I start the Robovac from the app on my phone. I come home to no hair! It covers my entire living room floor; in thr corners, along the baseboards, under the front of the couch and chairs, under tables etc. It literally gets everywhere. I empty the dust bin when I come home in the evening and its ready to go the day. I have not used the dust mop pads with it yet. I'll update my review when I do. I'm considering taking down the baby gate that seperates the living room from the rest of the house so it can get those areas also. This vacuum will also vacuum the thick mat I have the dogs water bowl sitting on. When I comes to the steps down into another part of the house it turns itself around to avoid falling off the step. Of course I do still have to vacuum the rest of the way under the couch and chairs. Due to their height, the Robovac can't get all the way under them, but it has definitely cut my floor sweeping in more than half. I use to think there was no way a little vaccum like that to handle the hair. I came across the Robovac on one of Amazon's daily deals and thought ""A that price why not give it a try"". I'm so glad I did! I don't know how I ever did without it now. I highly recommend this product."
4.0 out of 5 stars,Seems OK except it is not connecting to Alexa,"I got this robot vacuum because it specifically said you can control it with Alexa. I have followed the instruction manual and the associated app (Mi Home). When I ask Alexa to detect the device using ""Other"" (per Mi Home instructions), ""Vacuum"", and ""Switch"" (because some folks said they connected that way), Alexa just says no device found."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent 'no frills' robovac,"What differentiates this model from the other low cost vacs is its cleaning pattern. Most of them go straight until they hit something then turn in a random direction like a drunken sailor. In theory, they cover every inch of ground, but that's rarely the case. The E4 uses a 'back and forth' pattern - it goes straight across the room then makes a U-turn when it gets to the other wall (or an obstacle) and moves over one width. It doesn't miss areas like the other ones do."
4.0 out of 5 stars,Never cleans the entire 2nd floor,The suction power has been great. I am giving 3 stars because it never cleans the whole 2nd floor. Even when all the doors are open. I have to physically take it into a room and shut the door behind it to get it to clean that room. It also has a super difficult time finding the docking station.
4.0 out of 5 stars,"What is this, witchcraft?? Sorcery???","I vowed to never ever ever own a robot vacuum. Ever. The joke is on me because I bought one. And then a second. We‚Äôve had this for just over a week and run it every single day, twice a day. I don‚Äôt know where it is finding dirt. But man!!! It‚Äôs finding dirt!! I‚Äôm actually truly disgusted that I thought my floors were clean. Since we did hardwood floors on one entire level I have hated walking barefoot on and dreaded putting the baby down unless I had just mopped and vacuumed but now I don‚Äôt mind him crawling around because he‚Äôs not covered in crumbs all the time."
4.0 out of 5 stars,Works well despite the app and wifi not connecting,"As a standalone piece, this thing is awesome. It can go deal with changes in carpet to flooring no problem, the suctions is fantastic, the filter is easy to clean and the docking station is small enough to fit up against any wall. I am only disappointed in the model not connecting to wifi and therefore being unable to use the app. It would be cool to schedule cleanings and have the product go to different rooms in the house, but without the app this isn't possible. I certainly will purchase another one in the future and make sure the compatibility is a priority. I am very impressed with this lightening deal."
1.0 out of 5 stars,Unhappy with purchase. Poor battery life.,Poor battery life. It took 2 charging to vacuum
2.0 out of 5 stars,. I would purchase it more of a namebrand product.Difficult to connect up to Wi-Fi,May be a good vacuum but we were never able to get the software to link up with our Wi-Fi even after Assistance from Customer Service. They don‚Äôt own their own app Phone app. I think that makes a big difference company should have their own app. They use a Home app somewhat like Google home.
2.0 out of 5 stars,Wifi issues,"For a product that is ""so advanced"" you would think that the wifi setup would be easier. I did everything, followed all of the instructions both on the app and machine and no luck. Oh well!"
2.0 out of 5 stars,Poor performance,"This vac does not clean every room and it continually cleans the same areas over and over again. It skips rooms and doesn't clean a complete room. I have moved it to several locations and no matter where it is inconsistent and does not take clean large parts of a room. The area is 1200 sq feet of carpet, so not a large area. It stops periodically saying there is something blocking it and there is nothing there. Customer service has been prompt in answering my emails and offered a few suggestions (like moving it to a different room) but to no avail. In fact, it is getting worse. I'm very disappointed."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Dislike, wish I could return","I hate this vacuum and wish I could return, but I missed the window. It got stuck on stupid many time and would only go through my living room. A few times it would reach my kitchen and dining area. Sometime I would have to joystick through the app to get it to go somewhere else. Also the times it did get stuck numerous times cleaning the living room, it never really fully picked up my dogs fur well from the area rug. Even when ran daily, I would still see fur loose on the surface. I have one Medium size Pug/Beagle dog and he sheds a ton, I need something that can defur my house daily."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Why dont more people have these things (right over a full one inch transition like nothing),"I bought the roborock e4 (Belvedere) for my mother after i literally, meticulously watched about 150 video reviews on robot cleaners. I am beyond impressed it has totally surpassed all expectations in a large house that is all maple floor after sweeping it still gathered two full containers (which is one of the largest collectors on any vac), with 3 large long hair dogs it picks up hair great, and dog food great with out spilling the bowls of water. The add on moping system where my expectations were low , turns out works amazing looks as if it were mopped regular and mind you this was the first use of the mop when floor was full of prints. Also even though the water tank looks small it still had water after 60 m2 of cleaning. Granite it does not have all the bells and whistles but it does have plenty, though it may not have no-go zone, is a little piece of magnet tape really that hard im certainly not complaining, with tons of power settings, i heads right back to its dock when done or low battery and then will begin right where he left off. The navigation is incredible; makes clean back and forth sweeps and knows where it has been and has not. The dogs were not afraid after the first minute either (another surprise). And my favorite bit is he actually went over a full 1 inch transition to get in the kitchen like nothing, never in a million years did i think it would. All in all this machine is amazing, great with pets, mopping option worth it, plenty of features and all for 188.99 plus call it 40 for the mop and 15 for two extra washable / durable pads, there is really no other choice and have looked at many. -Kamron :) p.s. same motor and guts as the s4."
4.0 out of 5 stars,Just because it's a robot doesn't mean it's smart,"We named ours Wall-E. He does his best, but sometimes I think having one little rotary brush isn't enough and that he works too hard. He often gets stuck under the coffee table or kitchen counter and makes a horrible noise, I can only imagine what it sounds like to the downstairs neighbors. I haven't figured out the app yet, I got confused by what I was supposed to do but I'll try again soon. One thing I would like is for there to be a notification beep or something that tells me when the canister is full."
3.0 out of 5 stars,Robot vacuum,"This was a total impulse buy and I wanted to love it so bad. I recently developed a shoulder injury. With a lab puppy and three kids I vacuum a couple times a day sometimes with my cordless. I needed a break though and I was hoping this robot would be the answer to my prayers. Here's the deal when it worked it worked nicely. Not as good as my regular vacuum but I was happy enough. Here's why I returned it....it kept getting confused and going back to the hub. So it would vacuum one room, get stuck then go home. Or it would only clean a portion of the living room and then go back to the hub. I will give it credit for not falling down my exposed stairs and when it did clean it picked up a lot. For the price though I needed it to work properly not just 20% of the time. Return was fast and easy."
2.0 out of 5 stars,I want to love this but too many issues,"I really want to love this little vacuum but I wish I would have purchased a different model. The first time I used it, it worked great. As I continue to use it, it seems to get worse. It makes more and more random patterns and the lines it leaves are not straight, they are crooked. The bigger issue with this is when it comes in contact with walls; since it does not go in a straight line, it misses sections. Not very good for people with OCD either. It does not do a great job on lower pile carpets. It also will slow down for some objects but for others it will crash right into. It will randomly stop and just start spinning around all confused and then go off in a different direction. Placing it in front of the dock and telling it to go home, it will wander around and then finally decide to go home. This morning it had been charging all night, I went to use it and it wouldn‚Äôt turn on. Placed it back on the dock, it made its little jingle and turned on with 98% battery. I have had this over a month and am unable to return or exchange. I will reach out to the company and see if they have any recommendations!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Does exactly what we hoped it would.,"We ordered this product as an Amazon prime day deal almost reluctantly. Our situation was that we own two cats and a dog and have quite a challenge keeping up with the shedding and dust bunnies. Our upper floor of our split level home is laminate flooring, and this vacuum does great at cleaning up the hair and dust. Seriously, our floors have never been cleaner. I set up a schedule with it, and it runs each night for just over an hour. This unit would not let me integrate it with Alexa, but it still does the job I bought it for faithfully each day. I have not at all used it on carpet yet, so I can't comment on it's carpet performance yet, but we will likely get another one for the lower level eventually. Highly recommend for hardwood or laminate floors."
1.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth the trouble.,I should have read other reviews first. Many could not sync with their wifi or had a very hard time. After an hour I had enough and packed it up for return. If you like your sanity fo not buy this product.
2.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed! Can't connect,"I was very excited to find this online one weekend on sale! However once it arrived extremely disappointed that I was unable to get it connected to my wi-fi after watching videos, reaching out to support, and using the directions on the app. I did everything except call my internet provider to change my router settings which is a hassle and I shouldn't have to do. It said it would be easy to use with my Echo which is another reason I bought it but thats not the truth. The suction would've been great but at this price point if it doesn't have a remote and I can't connect it to the app Im not going to continue to bend down to manually hit the button. Even my last robovac had a remote that you could program and it was $99. I would not recommend this vacuum."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great starter vacuum robot, but...","This is my first vacuum robot and it works really well, and I'm happy with the purchase. I see no need to schedule it because it's just me here and I plan on using just a few times a week. There are some issues and things you need to know, though. This particular model uses a less functional software app called Mi Home. You cannot map your home and then control areas with it. While it may have an optional mop feature, I don't know how you would tell it which areas to mop and which to vacuum. You need to temporarily get everything off the floor and place things you want it to vacuum under out of the area or out of reach. You might move dining room chairs out of the room temporarily for it to really clean that area well. Loose cords can get wrapped around the brush so you need to tuck those away, too. You can control some things through the app but not everything. It can do the whole home and find the rooms on its own, but I've started putting it in a room and then shutting the door so it only does that room. It will try to go under everything it can. It may leave very light scuff marks on doors and walls as it needs to experience those boundaries to help with its navigation; it can only figure out where to go and what to maneuver around by lightly bumping into it and moving alongside it. I haven't tried to wipe off the scuffs yet because they don't look that bad and I don't want to do it every time. I saw one video where someone temporarily put a piece of cardboard over a part of a wall it didn't want the robot to scuff."
4.0 out of 5 stars,Pretty good,"I recently injured my back and sweeping and mopping are now off of my to do list. It used to be one of the chores I didn't like to ignore. There are three adults at home and before anyone gets huffy, we all have physical challenges. Paying someone is an option, but we are not to the point of having daily care. Much less expensive if a robot vacuum will fill in the gaps."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Best. Vacuum. Ever.,"This is my third robot vacuum in 5 years. My first was a Shark that got ruined by running over my dogs diarrhea, yeah thats a funny story. And my second was a Eufy that kept stripping the side brush gears. And now this Rockstar, the Roborock E4! This by far is far superior to both of my previous units. To start, the price was $199 (cheaper then both of the other models). One of my favorite things is that it leaves straight parallel vacuum lines, now my wife thinks I've been running the upright vacuum everyday, lol. Now it doesn't have a mapping system like the higher end models but it does have a laser eye on the front that pretty much works the same way as a mapping system. The battery time is massive at 3hrs! To clean my whole first floor, living room, dining room, kitchen, computer room, bedroom and two bathrooms it takes around two hours. So the battery is perfect. I watched a video about the E4 and it has the exact same suction power, battery run time, dust storage capacity as Roborocks most expensive units at $500. The only difference is the mapping system and wet mopping (which gets bad reviews). All in all, at $199, this vacuum is fantastic and I would HIGHLY recommend it!"
3.0 out of 5 stars,Good vacuum. Stupid robot,I also have a Roomba 600 series for many years and I say it's one of the best things I've bought. How RoboRock e4 compares:
2.0 out of 5 stars,No so smart for a smart robovac and extremely loud,"We purchased it as a replacement for our simple Shark Ion. I was very excited to have a vac with a navigation system and a mop. Oh my, the moment I turned it on I wanted to return. It was so loud even on their ‚Äúsilent‚Äù mode. If you are used to watch movies while robot cleaning the house- forget about it, you won‚Äôt be able to hear anything. The navigation system left much to be desired. Honestly I didn‚Äôt see a huge difference in movement pattern between my ‚Äústupid‚Äù old robovac and this smart one. Another fail is the design of a dust bin. It has so many crevices and corners you won‚Äôt be able to clean it properly. On top of it it stuck on my only carpet in the apartment unable to move through the pile(it‚Äôs a middle length pile). I didn‚Äôt want to try mopping not to get upset even more so I just packed and sent it back the next day. I really wanted to upgrade my old robot but now I don‚Äôt see the point if the differences are minuscule and in some case the new one performs worse."
5.0 out of 5 stars,LOVE this vacuum!,I have owned several Neato Robotics auto vacuums and liked them but they didn't get in the corners very well and they seemed to have trouble navigating certain areas. They always get stuck under the couch and I had to put magnetic strips to keep it from even going under the couch. I have always had to use my extended warranty on the Neato because they did go wonky on me.
4.0 out of 5 stars,It loses to iRobot,"Bought this little guy because it was fairly cheap (around $250) and had great reviews. Well, after I bought it, i was able to get my iRobot 960 to work again so I did some testing of my own. (I'll try and update this with a few pictures I took). I let this vac go first and vacuum up then I would run my Rumba960 and my Rumba would come back with a bin full of stuff that was bigger than the E4. I have a Shiba and he sheds like he is trying to supple the birds of the world with enough hair for a nice cozy winter. The E4 did about as good as the Rumba960 regarding pet hair, where is came up way short was in the dirt. My Rumba been had at least 3 to 4 times more dirt in its bin than the E4. I couldn't notice any difference on the floor (rugs mostly and some tile in the kitchen), but the difference was in the bins. The E4's bin was easy to get out of the vac, but I spilled in on more than one occasion once it was out. It was a lot cleaner, less messy vs the Rumba but the Rumba never spilled it and the bin was a little bit bigger."
4.0 out of 5 stars,A robot vac that can handle open concept,"Here's the situation. I have an open floor plan which appears to mean utter and total confusion for these robot vacs. The last one I had literally got so befuddled, it would just stop in the middle of the room for no reason over and over then would clean the same three foot by three foot area before the front door ten times over while missing entire rooms."
5.0 out of 5 stars,My favorite purchase ever.,"Okay I waited to submit a review until I have had Robuddy (that‚Äôs my pet name for him) for a month. Honestly it has changed my life in a subtle but impactful way in the one month we‚Äôve been together. I use him every day downstairs and a few times a week upstairs.. we have four furry pets including outdoor cats who spend lots of time inside and let‚Äôs just say I don‚Äôt want their tiny hopping bitey friends to overrun the place. Enter Robuddy! But that‚Äôs not how he‚Äôs changed my life that just why I bought him. So he‚Äôs changed my life because it gives me SO much pleasure to look at my clean floors every day. Way more than anticipated. The family (including two teens) helps keep the floors picked up for him and he has inspired me to clean other parts of the house too! I even bought a dustbuster so I can keep the carpeted stairs (ugh) as clean as the rest of the house. And I can get the tiny corners that Robuddy can‚Äôt quite get. He is quite big, like a foot or so in diameter, but so agile for his size - he just goes right under shelving and dressers and cabinets and beds. I have to block him from some under-areas where I keep stuff. heh. Sometimes I just stand and watch him work. The first few days I was distracted nearly the entire two hours he was cleaning and did not consider the time wasted. I mean the way he moves back and forth so neatly and sometimes goes in straight lines alll the way down a hallway and sometimes stops in the middle of the room and changes direction but there‚Äôs some sort of genius method to the madness because he always comes back and gets the spots he missed! So as distracting as he is I always get a little thrill coming home to clean floors with him sitting quietly in his dock. Once the cat knocked over a house plant and there was sooo much dirt on the carpet! I set Robuddy to spot-clean and he did amazing. I didn‚Äôt even feel like I needed to go over his work with a regular vacuum - that thing is going in the trash. Oh and he‚Äôs easy to empty the dustbin which did every day at first but I now do every other day or so. Yes, he‚Äôs my best purchase robot friend who does my work for me."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great vacuum and value for the price.,I've been using the vacuum daily for a couple of weeks now and have been very happy. Based on the vacuum app I have about 650-700 sqft. Of tile floor that gets done. The vacuum normally still has 60% power left minimum. Since I have 2 dogs and 2 cats I don't use it for rugged areas because I THINK it would fill quickly. Although at this point I may add a room or 2 with carpeting to the daily routine. I don't really have any issues with the vacuum other than the alexa skill doesn't seem to work well but to me that's not surprising for Alexa.
3.0 out of 5 stars,Customization is limited. Cleaning is ok.,I have hardwood floors that were just refinished and wanted something to help keep dirt off floors between cleanings.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Wonderful and useful!!!!,"Easy yo use, fast charging, low noise"
4.0 out of 5 stars,It does better than just bouncing around,"What I wish I knew before purchasing: it does not use the Roborock app. You use a different Chinese app that I didn't try after reading all the permissions it required. So I am using this by just pushing the button and letting it go. I wanted something that wouldn't collect hair on the brush. I also thought the mopping feature would be great to have. For comparison, I've owned a Roomba 690 for a few years. This collects less hair than the standard bristle brush Roomba 690 uses, but this E4 still required me to clean the long hair from the brush. The Roomba 690 also bumps into things rather hard, this one is more gentle on the baseboards. The suction is very good. In a room without many obstacles, it cleans in straight lines instead of bouncing from one thing to another like the Roomba 690. It does have trouble mapping out furniture and such. It will miss sections and gets lost, but I have not used the app. The mopping feature is pretty basic. I'm not sure if it's worth the extra price. Overall, it's a good budget unit if you want something that's a step up from the first ping-pong robot vacuums. The Roomba is still hard to beat with its cleaning power however."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"""Works with Alexa"" claim is true!!!","Revised review (prior review panned the vacuum): I had posted a 1 star review, complaining that linking the Xiaomi Mi Home app in the Alexa skills menu failed to give me voice control over this device (you set up the vacuum on your iPhone using their Mi Home app). Upon seeing my review, a Xiaomi representative emailed me privately, professionally, politely, to correct my user error. In fact, I had linked to the wrong app! Xiaomi provides a separate Alexa skill called Roborock Home that you must link Alexa to, using your Mi Home logon credentials. Now Alexa does in fact link to this robot! So, apologies to Xiaomi. I want to also point out other reviews I found here complaining that the device cannot be controlled by Alexa--it's not intuitive how to connect it, but once you figure it out the linkage does exist."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Fantastic machine,"I did a great deal of research before settling on the Roborock E4 and this unit is as great as they say. I needed a vacuum to keep up with our two dogs that shed 365 days a year as well as my hair, I shed a lot too. The reviews said the E4 had the best brush to prevent tangling, and they were right. I‚Äôve been using the unit for a month now and haven‚Äôt had to remove anything from the roller. Another pro it is has a large dust bin that can hold the whole hairy mess on the first floor of the house. Finally it is relatively ‚Äúsmart‚Äù. It does ‚Äúmap‚Äù the room so it knows where it has been and where obstacles are, it doesn‚Äôt just bounce around until the power runs out, it actually tracks back and forth so it knows when it‚Äôs finished. It also comes with an app to schedule cleaning, but I haven‚Äôt used it. There is an optional mop system too, but I haven‚Äôt purchased that‚Ä¶still considering. I charge it after every cleaning so it‚Äôs never run down. To clean the first level of our house takes an hour and a half and it does it on one charge. It can also go over the fray of our Asian area rugs without jamming, which was pleasantly unexpected. I highly recommend this vacuum! I only wish I had bought it sooner."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Does what it promises,"Years ago we had one of the R***ba original robotic vacuums and one of the same company‚Äôs mopping bots, as well. They were great, but after several years, they both failed and the company, having been sold off, hiked prices and, in our experience, lowered quality. We‚Äôve been looking for good replacements ever since. This Roborock is the best we‚Äôve encountered. It simply does what it advertises. the vacuum successfully deals with multiple carpets with fringe and doesn‚Äôt get stuck under furniture. It edge cleans better than any robot vacuum we‚Äôve had, and the mop feature doesn‚Äôt leave trails of water. I wish it had a spray/scrub/squeegee function, because a damp microfiber isn‚Äôt real mopping. However, this does a very good job of keeping up our hardwood kitchen floor and stone bathroom floors between moppings - and that includes dealing with a lot of pet and human hair. It‚Äôs also not as loud as brands we‚Äôve tried/returned and its battery duration between charges is quite good."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Sensor Problem - Such a Disappointment!,"Hi, I couldn‚Äôt find a way to reach the seller, I decided to write a review here."
4.0 out of 5 stars,Love it!,"I originally had my doubts and it seemed a little stupid compare to my Eufy before this. But it vacuums much better, learns as it goes, vacuums without missing areas, slows down before it hits things, the battery runs longer and doesn't get pet or long hairs stuck in the brush like the Eufy seriously did. I got a great deal for this when it was on sale at $229, but even if it'd been higher I'd be happy with it,"
3.0 out of 5 stars,"Inexpensive and does the job but not flexible, a bit flawed",Cons:
1.0 out of 5 stars,Wouldn‚Äôt connect to wifi,Never connected to WiFi. Robotics sent return label and I am currently waiting for replacement. Will update review once I get new one.
5.0 out of 5 stars,A great robot vacuum,I love how it knows when it's on carpet and increases the vacuum suction and then reduces on hard floors. You can change the vacuum on the app 3 different levels. Very easy to work with. Unlike some robot vacuums this one allows you to scedule as many days a week as you wish. I can't believe they make a robot vacuum that only allows for everyday only.
2.0 out of 5 stars,Not near as nice device with lots of caveats lots of them,Bought this and only drawback is that it does not seem to have a way to tell it to clean only one room or certain rooms. This makes a house with multi surface floors kinda pointless if you want to mop a tiled kitchen but not mop your carpet. Also had to take off the rubber spinner as it tangles up in the carpet. But its one screw so not huge deal. Had i known about the not able create room borders i would have bought a different one as i want a mop feature to instead of having the extra accessories i paid for just sit there. Remote control joystick has way to long of a delay to use it manually as well.

1.0 out of 5 stars,Worst buy of 2020,"Do not buy. I purchased this after reading a ( yes one) from vacuum robot wars that the E4 was the budget S5, it‚Äôs not."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Absolutely fantastic.,"The roborock has surpassed all our expectations. We previously had two roombas, both of which have long been broken. With two cats though, we really need something to run regularly. So far, this product has been absolutely fantastic, even without all the high-tech, fancy gimmicks. It navigates wonderfully, cleans great, and most importantly, is way more affordable than most robot vacuums."
4.0 out of 5 stars,My new favorite chore!!,"¬†I am so excited about this thing! It does a great job of daily cleaning. It is a task in itself to monitor the robot, but far easier than vacuuming and sweeping. For purposes of my review i have the S4 model and i bought the optional mopping attachment (this was far cheaper than the upgraded models that include a mopping attachment). This was reviewed on a 1600sq ft home (half tile/ half carpet)"
2.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth it! Do your research and get a better product,I‚Äôve had this thing for about 4 months now and I really wanted to like it. I wish I would have done more research and got a better product that actually worked.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Master Manipulator,"¬†The thing I like most about my Roborock E4 is the fact it manipulates and tricks me into picking up and putting away the things left out on my floor. It does this by sending alerts to my phone while I'm at work that I am not going to have a nicely vacuumed home awaiting for me to return because I lacked at putting my s**t away. It also achieves this when I'm home by mesmerizing me with it's abilities to vacuum up all the dirt and debris in a flawless zig-zagged pattern from my vinyl wood floors. In excitement and politeness for it to do it's job, I quickly remove all random objects from my floors that may come across it's path. If I don't, it yells at me in it's deep robovoice to get off my lazy butt and help get it's wheel unstuck from whatever random object that got in it's way."
4.0 out of 5 stars,Over all a good product with some worrisome problems,"This was my first time getting a vacuum robot, so I wanted to get something inexpensive to see if it actually works in my apartment. I was amazed at how much it picked up! Between my roommate and myself, there are 3 cats and 2 dogs, so lots of dirt and hair in the carpet. I am so happy I decided to buy this as a Christmas present for myself."
2.0 out of 5 stars,Nope.,"I can‚Äôt get this to connect to my Alexa to work right at all. I purchased this because I‚Äôm constantly running the sweeper every single day 2-3 times a day. I have two small boys. I wanted to spend less time cleaning/mopping. I wasn‚Äôt aware the mop system had to be purchased separately. I haven‚Äôt purchased it yet to try. I‚Äôm very disappointed in the sweeper itself. The battery doesn‚Äôt last long at all. It takes way too much time as it‚Äôs constantly going over the SAME exact spots. I have to remove it from the dock, put it in my kitchen and start it so it‚Äôll sweep the kitchen. It‚Äôs honestly a pain in the ass when it was suppose to be helpful. I‚Äôd recommend a different brand like Shark (I‚Äôve heard many good things about those)."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent robot vacuum for the price!,I'm in love with this vacuum robot. Excellent price for this item. Runs perfectly between hardwood floors and light carpets. Doesn't work in high pile carpets; the vacuum evades them. Does a great job in corners and tiles. It's not noisy and don't get trap because the sensors helps the vacuum to get out of difficult places. The dust bin is big enough to hold the dust of 2 or 3 cleanings. The filter is washable. The mop option requires to buy the attachment for this function.
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Cleans well, but has some negatives","I got this on a Black Friday special about $100 cheaper than the current price. So I'm happy to keep it, but would not be nearly as happy had I paid full price."
5.0 out of 5 stars,The best way to vacuum ;),"She's not quite Rosie rhe Robot, but there's not much better than having something vaccuum for you! (I usually swiffer mop a room as it's vacuuming another!) I still break out the real vacuum a few times a month to get in the places Roborock can't, but OH MAN, DO I LOVE THIS THING! In turbo mode, it gets everything up, including all that fine, tiny pitbull hair, and the longer kitty hair. I don't think it's as powerful as my upright or my dirt devil stick vac, but it's no big deal, because it just keeps going all around the room and eventually gets 98% of the dust and dirt. I got this brand because my friend got the waaaay more expensive roomba and loved it. I just couldn't justify spending that kind of $, so I started hunting for the best less expensive alternatives. And here we are. Although it doesn't have all the bells and whistles of the other brand, it has everything you need to get the job done. It finds it's way back to the base most of the time, and rarely ever gets stuck (one time out of the 20+ times I've run it). I like that there's a spot-clean option that wil clean in a small area 8f you put it just where you need it. I also like that you can start it cleaning by just touching a button on the unit and do not have to use your phone if it's not handy."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great vacuum for the price - not a random path vacuum,"Previous vacuum we had was an ecovac. I thought it was the most awesome robot vacuum until we recently got this. We liked this so much that we actually bought a second one for the upstairs instead of having to carry one upstairs/downstairs for cleaning like we did with the ecovac. First cleaning, and the bin was overflowing! Cleaning path is actually uniform as if you were vacuuming yourself, unlike the random path that our previous vacuum did. We run downstairs in the middle of the night every day and each time the dust bin is becoming less and less. Unlike the first cleaning when the bin was literally overflowing! What really sold us on getting a second one was its mapping feature. It actually maps out the area it cleaned and it is accurate! For the price, I did not hesitate on getting another one for the upstairs. Works with Alexa, but I have it on schedule to vacuum downstairs and upstairs when we aren't around. For the price, you can get 2 of these for the price of 1 popular robot vacuum. The dustbin could be easier to clean, but I'm ok doing a follow up vacuum to clean the filter after I empty it out. For the time and convenience and result this little robot provides in keeping our floors clean, I don't mind the extra effort in cleaning the dust bin. Great product, there might be better ones out there but for the price, I would not hesitate getting this one again."
5.0 out of 5 stars,What a pleasant surprise!,"My house is mostly hardwood floors with some rugs and this thing does great on them. I'm still amazed at the amount of dust and dirt it picks up everytime I empty the waste bin. My floors even feel noticeably cleaner on my feet, which is all you could ask for out of one of these things."

2.0 out of 5 stars,Not too smart,"I bought this one to replace a dead S5 thinking it would do okay. This e4's navigation abilities are terrible compared to the S5. That said, it does as good a job at cleaning as the S5 and with the larger bin, can clean better for longer. Where the e4 really breaks down is in the navigation around obstacles where it can fit under part, but not all, of the obstacle. The sensor at the nose of the robot ends up under a portion of the obstacle, the robot backs up and jams itself under the obstacle, starts to make terrible noises while spinning its wheels, and eventually gives up with an error. If this only happened once per cleaning in might be tolerable, but it gets stuck on half of the furniture in the house. It almost never properly completes a cleaning. Worse yet, when I un-jam it and place it down 6 feet away, it goes right back to the obstacle and gets jammed again."
5.0 out of 5 stars,WORLDS Better than my Eufy,"For starters, this should be better than the Eufy I bought because I bought these about 4 years apart and the technology alone has improved drastically."
1.0 out of 5 stars,Do not buy this if you have any high pile rugs or carpet!,I wanted to love this vacuum. I bought this mostly for the route planning function. I had a Shark robot vac that would bounce around from wall to wall and it always made me wonder if it was getting every area of the room.

1.0 out of 5 stars,BUYER BEWARE!! Horrified with this vacuum! Destroyed two expensive wool rugs!!,I don‚Äôt even know where to start with this review.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Works surprisingly well,"What works: suction is good, will miss some larger flat objects, moves from hardwood floors over throw rugs well, coverage is good, it is actually interesting to watch it work, whatever algorithms they used are very efficient. Picks up dog hair well."
2.0 out of 5 stars,Which software?,"I bought this recently after checking to see if Roborock has an Alexa skill. It does. The problem is the written instructions. In the box, they tell you to download a software MY home that is not Roborock. I went thru the whole process connected it to wifi and then tried to connect it to Alexa. After numerous frustration attempts and not finding the model e4 on the software, I read that the software should be connected to Roborock Plus . Downloaded it got it connected to wifi tried Alexa discovery and manually would not connect. Gave up and returned it the same evening it arrived."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Thumbs up!,I got this little Jewel of a vacuum during one of Amazon's deal of the day. I only had a couple of hours left to purchase it. So I read as many reviews as I could. So far after having it for about 6 months it's still working great! Sometimes it can't find its way home but you just pick it up and put it in the laundry room and push the button. And I don't know how I live without it with having cats and their cat litter getting everywhere no matter how much you sweep. Just make sure that you empty and clean the filter and cut any strings from the rollers and wheels. If you take care of it it will take care of your floors.
4.0 out of 5 stars,"1st Impression, should have got one sooner","Out of the box, charged to 30%, but I couldn't wait. Just push the button and it goes."
5.0 out of 5 stars,My best friend is a vacuum.,"I have always wanted a robot vacuum. My husband told me they were a waste of money. So we compromised and we got a robot vacuum. Unless he plans to vacuum every day, I win this argument. Our house is two adults, a 4 year old, and a chocolate lab. We live on acreage and never take our shoes off when we come in the house. Everything is a disaster."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Watch out for furniture damage, low mopping function in high traffic areas and failing sensors",**Update: Don‚Äôt buy this! Terrible customer service and it lasted only a few weeks!
5.0 out of 5 stars,Join the clean floor with minimum effort club,"I put off getting a robot vacuum for years, and now realize how silly it was not to jump on the wagon. For the price, this is a great little vacuum, and having clean floors without having to sweep or lug out the vacuum is revolutionary."
1.0 out of 5 stars,PIECE OF JUNK,"This stinks compared to their E25 the previous generation. This one rubs hard against my walls when it turns and has paint on the sides to prove it. My old robot doesn't damage my furniture or walls but this one does. This one also likes to get stuck, going over the same area 10 times, has worse wifi connectivity, has lower speaker/voice quality, and has lower grade mapping. I am unable to view a map of the robot as it is moving, only after it cleans. On the previous generation, I was able to track the robot live. My old robot is 2 years old and works better than this one which is brand new. This is an absolute piece of junk."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent value vac + mop,"Cleans up rooms well and quickly. We had a roomba a few years ago, I like the navigation much better with the e4. The e4 goes in straight lines not random angles like the roomba. You can even do a single room diagonally like you might do your lawn. Also we are very satisfied for the price, but know that the mop function is basically a damp mop which will keep itself wet with a reservoir. If you want a zamboni mop you'll spen alot more $. We are happy with the mop feature!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,My First and Favorite Vacuum,"Original configuration was a little difficult and tedious, but once configured, this became my best friend. I work 2 jobs, so it's nice to simply pick up cables and let the vacuum go. It cleans well, but I use it multiple times a day sometimes just to make sure things are getting clean. Not much more to say, it cleans my floors nicely. Spot cleaning is nice for getting under benches or chairs, just move them for a couple minutes, spot clean, put them back. Easy."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Good,"For the price range this is a great vacuum. I researched these vacuums for weeks trying to decide which one to buy. I would‚Äôve loved to buy a $1100 unit, but let‚Äôs be realistic here, middle class can‚Äôt afford something like that. Anyway, after much internal debate I decided on this guy I named s3xxy Rexxy. So far I have been impressed with the bang for my buck. I have 2 adult boxer dogs and am happy with the performance with pet hair. Does it have all of the bells and whistles of the more expensive models? No, but the suction is great, and it moves in straight lines. Truly that‚Äôs all I need. This unit doesn‚Äôt allow you to map certain rooms and schedule them, that is a feature really would like to have. You can schedule a cleaning, and it will clean everything it has access to, not just a specific area. It does great on both hard floors, carpet, and (non tasseled) rugs. The ability to purchase the separate mop attachment is a bonus as well."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Goes right under the bed - goodbye dust bunnies!,"I have owned this for less than a week, but I love it so much! I have 4 dogs and a cat and they all shed like crazy. I mean CLOUDS of hair. I was losing the battle because I simply did not have the time or inclination to vacuum my entire home top to bottom up to twice a day to keep it under control, but that's fine, because now I have this to do it for me!"
3.0 out of 5 stars,Mopping function does not work well on floor tiles,"It has good suction and works well as a vaccum cleaner. Mopping function is ok on hardwood but on ceremic floor tiles, it gets stuck in the middle of the floor with no obstructions. I raised the concern to the customer service, shared videos and got a confirmation that it seems to be skidding on tiles and it won't work. They offered me to return it as it was still withing 30 days of purchase or a $30 refund as a compensation. If mopping is an essential feature you are looking for this is not for you."
2.0 out of 5 stars,This won't work if your carpet is not SUPER tight low pile,"I wanted to like this since the price was pretty reasonable but I think it's almost absurd that it won't actually vacuum carpet. I have very low pile carpet - but there is some pile. In fact, I would not even rate my carpet as being ""medium pile"" and yet this unit constantly got stuck on it. It's weird. I actually bought 2 - one for upstairs and one for downstairs and they both had the same problem."
5.0 out of 5 stars,So good and such nice lines !,Love this thing! I bought it a couple of months ago and wanted to write an accurate review so I waited.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Totally worth it!,"I‚Äôve used this 3 days in a row it‚Äôs awesome. I have a tile, hardwood, carpet main floor with 2 young kids. I have made sure to have toys and stuffed picked up before we start it but it transitions seamlessly between floors. It does NOT do good with my 2 area rugs that have fringe and I pick those up now too. It did great with my rug without fringe but longer then today it got stuck on that so I‚Äôll pick that up to probably. It‚Äôs still worth it to just take 2 second to pick those up and have the vacuum run around the house. It leave the prettiest vacuum lines on my carpet and it goes back and forth in lines like advertised. I was amazed at how much dirt and dust I emptied out of the canister. I did use it on my upstairs all carpeted second floor. It did a great job, however it kept going under the beds and if you have anything under them it gets stuck. I don‚Äôt see myself using it upstairs at all, but if you don‚Äôt use storage under the bed then it worked really good in my guest room! Also as I‚Äôm typing this review we are watching a movie, we have the vacuum running and it‚Äôs not horribly loud. It‚Äôs just so nice to turn it on and let it run while we can relax. It‚Äôs still not perfect and it probably does miss spots in my house but I‚Äôm thoroughly satisfied that I got a ‚Äúlower end‚Äù model at a more affordable price point."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Value for the $$$,"¬†So far so good with the Roborock E4. Installing the app and setting it up on my Android phone was easy enough. After it charged to 100%, I let it rip. It does exactly what is in the description. It comes off the dock and runs a straight line across the floor until it bumps into something. then it turns left, moves a few inches and comes back toward the dock. It does this zig zag motion until the entire house is vacuumed. It's logic is good and it doesn't miss many areas that I've noticed. My entire house is hardwood with one very plush area rug in my living room. I knew it wouldn't work but I tried vacuuming the plush rug. It automatically increased its power and suction but took forever to find its way off. Now I roll the rug up and put it on the couch when the Roborock is running. Based on what I saw it will work fine on low or medium pile carpeting. The logic it uses intrigues me. It knows where it left off so once it finishes circling my kitchen island, it continues without a hitch. My house is one story with 2 BDS and 2 BTH. It takes about 90 minutes to run its routine and it automatically returns to the dock. Cleaning the debris collection box is simple. I keep a clean house normally so it mainly picks up dust, cat hair and stray cat litter particles. Don't leaves toys or power cords laying around because they will get caught in the unit. I don't feel it's too noisy as I can talk on the phone while it's running and hear just fine. I'm very happy with this purchase and would recommend to friends."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Would Buy Again,"I was in desperate need of a vacuum that would help manage the dog hair situation in my apartment. I have a German Shepherd mix that sheds like crazy. My old vacuum was a budget purchase that helped, kind of, but never really made a significant impact. I spent a day researching robo-vacs and landed on this one. If you don't need a self-emptying canister, Lidar mapping, or any other bells and whistles, this vacuum is a great option. My floors are finally the level of clean I've been hoping for with a slightly more expensive machine, but not one that breaks the bank. I hope this one lasts a long time, but just to be safe, I also purchased the extended warranty based on prior experiences with other brands. Regardless of the add-on, the price was reasonable considering this little guy will handle 90% of the vacuuming duties all on his own."
1.0 out of 5 stars,Leaves black marks on white trim,"I wanted to love this. In fact, I did love it until I realized that each time it was vacuuming it was leaving black streak marks all over our brand new white floor trim. Our home is less than two months old and I had to go around on my hands and knees and scrub nearly all of our trim. In some areas the scrubbing did not work and I had to paint it. Incredibly frustrated needless to say. What good is a vacuum that cleans your house, only to leave black streaks all over the floorboard. Unfortunately I‚Äôve missed the return window and am now stuck with the vacuum and can‚Äôt use it. I suppose it would be fine if you have dark wood trim. I am Extremely frustrated I spent so much money and can‚Äôt use the vacuum."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Give it a chance... fantastic once you figure it out!,"I have to admit, I'm a little bit embarrassed about how much I love this little bot, which I've nicknamed The Mystery Machine a la Scooby Doo."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Best i have had.,"This is my 3rd robotic vacuum and by far the best, Had a Roomba, but after a year or so, would just sit there spinning, changed the sensors, then it just spun the other way, trashed it. Next i had a Neato vacuum, much better than the Roomba basically because it had a pattern to vacuum where as the Roomba was all over the place But the batteries died, replaced them, worked for awhile then battery problem again, trashed it. Now this vacuum is way quieter seems to have a plan where to vacuum and does a great job. So far so good."

5.0 out of 5 stars,We‚Äôll worth the time and money,I‚Äôve looked at robotic vacuum cleaners for several years but never could come to spending the money on one. I recently purchased a home that has hardwood floors and travertine tile with only a few rooms with carpet. I decided I didn‚Äôt want to dust mop vacuum nearest much so I found this device during prime day. At first I was leaning towards a rumba but when I looked at the specs on this thing and the price point I didn‚Äôt think I had a whole lot to lose. I paid $199 for it on prime day and it‚Äôs one of the Best Buy‚Äôs I‚Äôve made a long time. Vacuum cleaner Sweeps about 2000 ft.¬≤ of my downstairs in 1 hour and 45 minutes. It really is thorough in it‚Äôs cleaning and I like seeing the vacuum path marks in the carpet. It looks very professional!
4.0 out of 5 stars,Horrible phone app!,"4 or 5 stars on the vacuum. I was impressed how it covered all areas, including under beds which are tough for me to hand clean. It's fun to watch. I knew the first vacuuming would fill the dust container, and it was a pleasure to see how much it picked up, including the many tiny pieces of fine-particle dust that are visible on wood floors. The cat is a little cautious but maybe I can train her to sit on it for the ride of her life. ;-) Zero stars to the phone app. It is the WORST app I've ever used, and I'm an advanced computer user who runs a business with many programs and apps. I gave it 2 hours and gave up. The app is not intuitive at all. Even when it tells you to go on to the next step, it hangs, and you have to go back and redo a step. I think this is common in Chinese software. Lord knows how many times the instructions have been translated and re-translated. Chinese hardware can be very good, but the apps are worthless. At least I can push the start vacuum and the home button by hand."
5.0 out of 5 stars,This is one of the best purchases I've ever made,"I'd give this little vacuum cleaner 100 stars if I could! I've been using a stick Dyson for years now, coupled with frequent steam cleanings. (My floors are mostly travertine and hardwood with a few area rugs.) I thought I was doing a decent job. But the first time I used this little gadget the dustbin was filled with cat hair and kitty litter dust. Second and third times too! It seems that the little whip cords that stick out the side of this machine beat dirt and dust out of carpets much more effectively than mere suction will do."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Incredible upgrade from Eufy random pattern robot,"This does a much better job of thoroughly cleaning when compared to a 2018 low priced random pattern robot. It also gets stuck way less often. It cleans where I want it to every day with a minimum of fuss. We have three large area rugs: a cheap low pile ikea rug, a deep shag, and a hand loomed Persian. We also have four furry pets. It keeps all the rugs looking and feeling persentable. I suppose the occasional deep clean would be necessary if we were the kind of people who lolled on rugs but for now the robot is good enough."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I love this vacuum!,"I love this vacuum. A friend of mine has the same vacuum but a more expensive model and was raving about it. I was going to buy the expensive model but this one was on sale so I thought I‚Äôd go ahead and try it out. I‚Äôm so glad I did. This little guy has almost all the same functions/power that the more expensive model has. I can program it to clean or can start it using the app. It picks up even the smallest bits of dirt. It‚Äôs easy to use. I do recommend getting the optional mopping system if you have hardwood floors. My only problem with this vacuum is that it can‚Äôt sweep my very high-pile shag rug. But for regular carpet, tile, hardwood, etc. this is perfect ! I love it so much that I‚Äôm going to buy a second one for my upstairs."
4.0 out of 5 stars,Worth it!,"We purchased another robot vacuum before this one and after reading some tech site reviews and talking with my sister in law, decided to purchase this and see how it compares. I have to say, I love the suction and how well it cleans. I also love that it maps out the house and I can see where it cleaned. I love that it cleans in straight lines‚Ä¶something I didn‚Äôt think I cared about but did after the previous robot vacuum did not. I will say, make sure you have ALLLLL your items off the floor - cords, toys, etc. It does not discriminate and will suck up everything it can. I also noticed it is not a fan of floor fans and will get stuck on them. However, I love the battery life. Our home is 1411 sq feet and it can clean the whole house on one battery charge. If it does more deep cleaning and runs out of battery before it‚Äôs done, it has no problem finding the docking station to charge and then it resumed cleaning where it left off once it charges to 80%. I would say all around, great purchase and has given me one less thing to worry about every day. I would buy again!!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,Junk.,Update: broke after a week and a half of use. The company won't replace it because I bought it from Amazon instead of directly through them.
4.0 out of 5 stars,Good and helpful device,"I like the fact that I rarely have to vacuum the house. In fact, my floors are cleaner since we got the Roomba than they have been in a long time. We are getting older, 79 and 80 respectively, and this is making my life lots easier (and cleaner.)"
1.0 out of 5 stars,Poor- update: PHENOMENAL!!!!,¬†Works great! Problem is 10 times tried to get it to hook up to my wi-fi to no avail. See product support couldn‚Äôt even get it to work. Sending back.
4.0 out of 5 stars,Game changer,"¬†This little gal (we named her Rosie, as in The Jetsons) has been a game-changer for us. With 2 dogs, there is hair everywhere. We have a tile floor, with a throw rug. This lil thing cleans it all up. I'm surprised when I open the dirt bin how much hair and dirt it collects! It easily transitions from the rug to tile. It is a bit noisy, but not close to how loud a regular vaccum can be. The app could be much better, but it does the job. Overall, I've never owned a name brand robot vaccum, but why spend that much if this gal does the job?"
3.0 out of 5 stars,Not what we Needed but Might Work for You,"I have a 2300 square foot home and this robot wasn't able to clean it effectively. It had a lot of trouble finding the kitchen (only about 20% of the time). Also, it would clean and then re-clean rooms several times, while completely skipping others. It also had a really hard time finding its way back to the charging dock and frequently got stuck under out kitchen table."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"When it works, it‚Äôs good. Constant connectivity issues.","When it works, it works pretty good- the issue is that the connectivity is awful and it constantly disconnects from our WiFi network which nearly makes it useless. I have to reset the connection manually so often (which also isn‚Äôt perfect and takes a few attempts usually). I have a ton of other smart devices in my home that work just fine."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent piece of machine!,We like this cleaning robot very much. It leaves our floors dust free and it is strong enough to remove even the tiniest cat hair. We just received the mopping system and haven‚Äôt tried yet but I‚Äôm pretty sure it will only enhance the experience. Excellent customer service. I definitively recommend this product to others and will come back for part replacement as needed.
5.0 out of 5 stars,I love this thing!,"I love this thing! I had a Roomba in the past and wasn‚Äôt impressed with it at all. We paid A LOT for it and it got stuck places, the bristles on the brush broke off, it rarely found it‚Äôs dock on its own, the dust bin was hard to empty, and it was always stranded on the edges of our area rugs. It was just a letdown overall. I missed having a robot vacuum after it died and did a ton of research and landed on the Roborock E4. I love this thing! It has NEVER not found its dock after cleaning, it does a very thorough job of cleaning, even without LIDAR navigation, and the dust bin is large and can last several days without emptying (and I run it multiple times a day). I also like that the dustbin is easy to clean if it gets gross. The machine itself is sturdy and durable. I was hesitant to buy a vac from a company I had never heard of, but I‚Äôm so glad I did. I like this little guy 10x more than my Roomba at a third of the price. Would definitely recommend."
4.0 out of 5 stars,Good cleaning and value,"4.5 stars. Great price. Have it running 3-4 days in a row now. Took a little bit to connect to the WiFi but once connected it‚Äôs been great. Set up a schedule. First couple passes picked up a lot of dirt. Filled it up. Just completed this morning‚Äôs route and very little dust now. It got stuck a couple times early on in tight spots that my old robot vac always got stuck on too. It did suck up phone cable this morning but that‚Äôs more my fault for leaving it out. It has been able to find the charging base itself after missing it once early on. The MiHome app is pretty thorough. Shows you the cleaning routes, time in use, sq meters cleaned, battery levels, maintenance schedule for the various parts. Many more options and info than I really need. Main thing is it cleans well. Got it for $200. Not the fancier lidar models but I think it‚Äôs doing quite alright without it and I saved that $300-400."
1.0 out of 5 stars,Total disappointment.,"¬†I am so disappointed. I have waited a long time for this purchase, but it is being returned. It does not have mapping, despite the pictures shown. I can‚Äôt get it to connect to the app for anything. I consider myself tech savvy, so it‚Äôs not user error."
1.0 out of 5 stars,Worst robo-vac ever - Buy anything else,"This is the worst robovac I have ever used. First, their remote ""app"" is completely worthless...so buy one with a physical remote. Second, it only cleans 12 mins. and then announces it has finished cleaning and docks itself...while the floor still has dirt on it. It has caused me to slam my fist on a table no less than three times...and I just started using it this week!!! I bought this to replace a $100 older model, thinking spending more meant better...WRONG! I'm going back to my old model and selling this piece of junk on virtual marketplace for whatever I can get for it."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Love our ""Cupcake"", even though she's dumb.","After our original robot vacuum bit the dust, I searched for a more affordable option and found this item. It shipped quickly and was easy to fire up. ""Cupcake"", as my 7 year old named her, is awesome. She runs a solid 3 hours over rugs, hardwood, and tile. I foster dogs and for the past week have had 4 in my care. Cupcake kicks butt when it comes to keeping my floors clean of pet hair, dander, dust, and legos from my children's carelessness. The filter is easy to empty and clean out."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent for daily cleaning,I love being able to come home to a freshly sweet carpet every day. It's really cut down on the cat hair and dust in my house. I also love the ability to attach a mop head and let it mop around the hard floors. I usually fill it with HOT water to clean better and clean the cloth a couple times and change out the now-cold water for hot to really get the floor well mopped. Still easier than doing it myself!
2.0 out of 5 stars,Not a Smart robot for a Smart home,"It‚Äôs a decent robo vacuum. I had a roomba, but my Great Dane ruined it. I wanted to try something a less expensive just in case it happened a second time. I really like this little vacuum. It picks up a good amount of dirt and dog hair which is important with two dogs and a toddler. I think I read a review that it was quiet, but I don‚Äôt agree with this. It‚Äôs just as loud and annoying as my roomba was. I‚Äôm giving it such a low score because I cannot get it to connect to WiFi. This is really important to me since sometimes I don‚Äôt have my phone and would like to be able to tell Alexa to send it home, or to be able to start it before I get home. It shouldn‚Äôt be that hard to connect it to WiFi and have the app work. I‚Äôm very disappointed. I would send it back, but I‚Äôve been using it for a week. We just moved and didn‚Äôt have WiFi until two days ago. I‚Äôve reset my phone, deleted the app, turned off the vacuum.. everything. Really need to fix their line up and their app."
5.0 out of 5 stars,BEST INVENTION EVER!,"I was a bit skeptical about whether this or the Roomba or whatever would really work. I have two dogs and live on a farm, so you can imagine all the dirt that gets tracked in my house. We put down new flooring so I wanted something to help keep things cleaned up. After some research, I decided to give this a try. I am in love with it. I scheduled it to run every day and it finds and cleans every inch of my house that it can physically get to. Even under my bed and couch. It does get stuck under the edge of my dishwasher occasionally, but I block that off every morning so that it can't get under the edge. That really is my only complaint so far. I've been using it for over two weeks and I'm thrilled. I love the app too. Definately worth the money. We have the mopping accesories too. It does make a difference in keeping the floor looking better between my more heaving moppings."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Okay Robot Vacuum,"Well this was our second robot vacuum cleaner after the first (cheaper) one really malfunctioned. This Roborock was better, but often got lost, couldn't return to charging base, missed areas, and didn't know which room it was in. I could not deal with this self-proclaimed artificially intelligent cleaner guy too long. As I started to lose my patience, we decided to return it. After returning to self-vacuuming, I have just started looking for a superior robot vacuum cleaner again. My extensive research is leading toward Roborock S6 Max that uses lidar along with artificial eye (camera). It is supposed to be very good."
5.0 out of 5 stars,The best and lower cost,"I had been researching these mobile vacuums for several months and saw this brand that did not rate all that bad.. Then I saw a review on Amazon somebody wrote their mother came over to their house and said that this mobile vac was better than her Rumba.. And I thought well It's probably a planted review but the price was good so I got one. Best decision ever. The suction is fantastic And has accidentally picked up things I thought would have broke it . Picked up hair combs, plastic from a box wrapping and various other things it didn't slow down. I was so impressed. And then I have this ledge between hardwood floor and the kitchen and thought I'll have to pick it up and put it on one side and put it on the other. It's quite amazing it comes up on it and doesn't get over it the 1st time and it spins around and gives it another try and it just keeps spinning until it gets to a place that he can haul itself over it and thick area rugs. I think it puts Rumba to shame. I call him Roco."
1.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth the saving,"It works fine, BUT it doesn‚Äôt work at all with Google Home. If you search online, you will find long forum discussions about this issue! It is very well known and Xiaomi is totally aware of it. But this is still advertised as compatible with Google Home, it is simply not."
4.0 out of 5 stars,We Feel So Cared For!,"We have a long-haired cat and a giant rough collie: hair builds up in the house every single day. And I have asthma...We've never been able to get ahead of it all with regular vacuuming. With Covid, we're no longer having the housekeeper come in, and being older, knew we had to do something. After a good deal of research, we selected the E4, and are so very happy with it. It has amazing suction, goes up onto our thicker living room carpet with ease, has cleaned way under furniture that likely has never been reached w regular cleaning. The house smells so good! The pattern it makes takes a while to trust, but it makes its way back to every inch of every room...and to its charger. We wish the roller brush was a little easier to clean, but have been told there is an upgraded brush available with screw off end caps that will improve that process. It's odd to feel actually kind of fond of this thing: it has made my breathing so much better. It's a good choice and we recommend it."
4.0 out of 5 stars,Good vac BUT....Models with mapping and no-go zones much better.,"While this vacuum does a good job cleaning, I do regret not spending the extra $$ the first time around and getting one with mapping. Setting up the magnetic strips (not included) to keep this E4 from going into and (sometimes) getting stuck in unwanted areas offset the convenience of using a robotic vacuum. I wound up purchasing a Roborock S6 Pure that had mapping, multiple maps, and no-go zones. A much better experience than this E4. This E4 is now relegated to the finished side of the basement where it has no obstacles and is gets around with no problems. Unless you have wide open spaces with no obstacles and no places it can get stuck, spend the extra money. Not Roborock's fault, I just didn't know how much better it would be with a model with the mapping features."
3.0 out of 5 stars,E4 model is Alexa ready but hard to set it up,"Sucking power is very good. Picked up all the dirt and hairs on the floor. Very hard to get the Mi smart home app to find and connect to this model of Robotic vacuum cleaner. After many tries and attempts, I was able to get my cellphone connected to this device. This E4 is not Alexa ready. Alexa skill only recognized Roborock skills that connects to Roborock app, unfortunately doesn't support e4 model. Misleading ad on Amazon. That's why I gave 3 stars instead of 5."
3.0 out of 5 stars,Good Vacuum. Terrible App,I bought the vacuum along with the accessory mop feature. The vacuum is pretty good but don't have any wires lying around or its liable to drag them with it. maintenance seems pretty easy too. If you have dark surfaces it will crash into them at full speed. Anything sitting just a bit over its operable height will scratch the top of the robot and may damage whatever it ran into.
1.0 out of 5 stars,Horrible customer service and horrible vacuum that won‚Äôt last 10 months.,"Absolutely worst product you can possibly buy. The vacuum doesn‚Äôt even last a year. Mine started having an issue at 10 months. It stopped going over tiny little surfaces between my kitchen and living room so I called support and for weeks they sent me through a loop. First they wanted a video which was reasonable so I did that. Then they didn‚Äôt believe me on my measurement of the surface and said it was over an inch so I sent them a picture to show them it was only .4 inches. Then they told me to clean the wheels which I do already so I did and then that whatever I use to clean the surface was causing it. Funny I used the same thing to clean the surface which is just vinegar for the first 8 months and it didn‚Äôt have an issue. After that they wouldn‚Äôt contact me back. I called customer service probably 4 times to ask for a supervisor and they told me they would call me the next day. It‚Äôs been 2 months and still no one has contacted me. They told me to contact via email to get a supervisor so I did probably 6 more times with no avail. They have the absolute worst and rudest customer service of any company I have ever dealt with. My product was still right at the 1 year warranty and they lead me along to lead me out of the warranty period. BEWARE, DO NOT buy anything from this customer. Vacuum is trash and customer service is ever worse. Do yourself a favor and buy a shark or Roomba. It‚Äôs worth the extra money. Hope this helps!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"So far, so good 2,200 square foot house and 5 pets...","I have a Husky, Malamute and 3 medium hair cats, and live in dusty AZ., this little machine is a godsend!! Haven't tried the mop yet, still replacing some carpet with hardwood, and read the reviews on how it doesn't recognize differences between the two. It does know the difference between various types of rugs and flooring. Currently I have tile, harwood and minor carpet, and rugs. Pics of cats are from different house, but so you can see their fur. Still have to clean under some area due to vacuum height, but talk about time saving as a whole !!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Overall Bang for Your Buck,"I didn't want to spend a whole lot of money on a robot vacuum, especially since I'd never owned one before and was skeptical of how well it would perform. This product blew me away! I named it Alfred and it picks up most of the dog hair, dirt, grass, and occasional cord hanging from the wall. I can't believe I've waited so long to get one. It doesn't fall off my step down into the bathroom, and it goes right over the high threshold I have in my home (my home is rented and the floors are warped to where it has a gradient, which is weird at the thresholds but Alfred doesn't flinch. I wanna get the mop extension so i don't have to sweep or mop."
3.0 out of 5 stars,Meh Navigation and Security Risk Surprise!,"Missed part of the living room altogether. Path was a little more random than I would have liked... definitely not the long, square lawnmower rows advertised. Does a great job of actually vacuuming. But a random-path is a lot less expensive and just isn‚Äôt that much worse in terms of coverage. Well, actually, my random path vac does cover the whole room, so that‚Äôs one better than this vac did."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Third Time‚Äôs The Charm,"This is my third robot vacuum. Started off with a Deebot, which really didn‚Äôt get the job done. Then went with the irobot 960, which couldn‚Äôt finish cleaning my main floor (hardwoods) on either one charge or without requiring the dust bin to be emptied."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Does a great job vacuuming a complex floorplan with furniture,"The Roborock E4 Robot Vacuum Cleaner, Internal Route Plan with 2000Pa Strong Suction, 200min Runtime does a good job navigating and vacuuming a complex floorplan with furniture. It transitions between ceramic floors, wood floors and carpet with no problems. I have an old Kenmore upright vacuum that indicates the amount of dirt it picks up and after running the Roborock E4 on carpet, I followed up with the old Kenmore Vac and it showed no dirt left behind. The noise level fluctuates from moderate sound on carpet (from higher vacuum rates) to almost a whisper on hardwood floors and ceramic tile. I like that it maps the floor and vacuums with 6 inch overlap. It follows up by vacuuming the edges. It finishes by heading back to the docking station."
3.0 out of 5 stars,WON‚ÄôT WORK ON MEDIUM DENSITY CARPET!,WILL NOT WORK ON CARPET unless the carpet is very low. I‚Äôve included a pic of my medium plush carpet for example.
3.0 out of 5 stars,Not the brightest robot,"We have had this little robot four months. We chose it for its ability to clean dog hair, which we have in excess, and it does ok at that. However, overall it is disappointing. Its navigation seems to depend on bonking into the walls so all of the white baseboard are scuffed now. More disappointing, it can‚Äôt navigate between rooms of it doesn‚Äôt accidentally find the door. It‚Äôs a pinball robot - bouncing from one obstacle to another."
4.0 out of 5 stars,Does a fairly good job of cleaning,Seems to do a descent job of cleaning for a relatively inexpensive unit. I have two old Roombas that are probably 10 years old and this cleans about the same (maybe a little better) and I do like that when it goes over a carpet the suction increases. I miss the virtual walls that the Roomba has to block off areas that do not have doors. The more expensive model has virtual walls that you can add to the programmed room map. This one does not have a map that you can see on your phone. It does connect with Wi-Fi and you can establish a cleaning program and can see its charge status and when it is docked on your phone. It may do more but that is all I have used. I went with this vacuum because of its low cost compared to others with the features I wanted.
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Helpful, but flawed","6 month update: Pathfinding has gotten progressively worse. I've cleaned all the sensors but it it has started to run into larger and larger objects, push light objects like shoes on the floor around, scrape walls while turning, and it has begun to wedge itself under objects. It has opened my fridge several times and has repeatedly gotten stuck under a cart that has maybe a millimeter of clearance from exactly the right approach angle."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I can‚Äôt imagine our home without it!,"Hands down, this vacuum has been a life saver. Our house is 4 floors and 3000sq feet- all hardwood and many area rugs, which means I spend way too much time vacuuming..."
2.0 out of 5 stars,Not the best robot vacuum on the market,"This vacuum says it‚Äôs good for larger homes but it always died after vacuuming half of my house. It did not map my house at all! I noticed it only would clean half of my living room, my dining room and half of my breakfast area. I had to carry the vacuum around so it would get in and out of the rooms."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Better than cheap-o options,"I just got this today AFTER I purchased another, cheaper robotic vacuum on Amazon. This one is instantly better! Why?"
4.0 out of 5 stars,Keeps the place looking better,"I think the E4 is a good value. My only con with it is that the agitator brush doesn't like carpet. My carpets pretty crappy though. Maybe a nicer denser carpet would work better. The brush feels a lot of resistance on mine and is usually not spinning. It seems to pick up about 95% of dirt on the hard floors or smooth carpet, and about 75% on my crappy carpet. It won't replace my dyson, but does do a great job of keeping the floors looking clean between weekly dyson vacuumings. Oh and on carpet, the power is on full, so it's noticeably louder. Ours is set to run daily at 9pm after kids are in bed and things are picked up. We live in a ranch so it does the whole house minus the bedrooms at night. You will know when it's near your door"
3.0 out of 5 stars,Mapping and mopping could be improved,"See the photo. The circled area is a hallway from one room to another but robot got confused on a way back and mapped it as 2 separate hallways. I think it would improve cleaning if robot could map the perimeter first and then clean the inside of it. It also would be nice to see the line trajectory inside of the mapped area as well as real time mapping while robot is cleaning. Mopping water flow is not controlled through app, also see the picture it only snaps on one side only and I can see it break quick when it tries to climb things over and over"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good Vacuum, Dock Charger Suspect",Pros:
2.0 out of 5 stars,Vacuum not great on carpet,"I liked that this robot vacuum talked and was easy to operate with a button. I didn‚Äôt like that it constantly (every 10 minutes) stopped and asked that an obstacle be removed, despite the fact there was no obstacle. It did this over and over on my carpeted floors. A push of the button had it on its way again for about 10 more minutes. Since there is no remote control, it could not be left alone and you constantly restarted it. Not worth it! It had a strange pattern for cleaning and was slow and would not get to certain areas. We returned it and exchanged it for another identical vacuum, thinking we just got a lemon. The new one did the exact same thing. It was also returned."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Half the price and actually better than my Roomba,"For a third of the price, I am far more impressed with this vacuum than my old roomba. It runs longer than my roomba and it gives my carpet straight up and down lines. The suction is obviously strong as it picks up everything. I actually bought this brand by accident-I came to Amazon to try the eufy but accidentally clicked the roborock. When it came I was initially going to return it for the other but thought I‚Äôd give it a test run. Absolutely love it. I run it every single day and it only got ‚Äúlost‚Äù once. My roomba was always getting lost and getting stuck under my kitchen cabinets. It does have an app to control it from your phone but I haven‚Äôt downloaded that yet."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Should have bought one years ago!,I have not yet tried the mopping function - so I can't comment on that.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Best purchase ever made,"This dude is a game changer. First off - I have 3 dogs - Let me be more specific - I have 3 Australian Shepherds - so the dog hair is REAL here. I watched a ton of YouTube reviews on different robot vacuums and was really impressed by the review from VacuumWars on this specific model and for this price I decided why not try. It has not disappointed let me tell you. The suction power is great, it‚Äôs very smart and gets every corner of the house and always manages to find its way back to the dock. I did have some problems with the app - but I didn‚Äôt buy it for the app - I can do everything I need to from the robot itself. It‚Äôs super easy to empty the trash bin, and parts to replace are affordable. I highly recommend everything about this!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,BEST DECISION EVER,"This has been, by far, one of the best purchases I have made. I have bought several of these for friends and family. You do not know what you're missing out on until you buy one of these robots. If I could give it 10 stars, I would!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Repeated errors, does not work properly at all esp. for mopping","I tried this in my kitchen only, since it's a small space and I wanted to get a good look at what this could do. I guess the sweeping part was fine, but when it came to mopping, the thing keeps stopping and telling me ""Error 8, please remove all objects."" Well, the thing is in the middle of the floor with nothing around it so it's clearly malfunctioning."
4.0 out of 5 stars,I DONT' RECOMMEND IF YOU HAVE A LONG-HAIRED DOG,"The vacuum works, but with a German Shepard and cats - the robot doesn't suck up all the hair and the suction starts to suck after a month. I have to dissemble it and clean it out almost daily because the hair gets trapped in the spinner, in the cracks of the vacuum, and also in the wheels. I love the idea of a smart vacuum but when i have to go over the floor with my normal vacuum, it defeats the purpose of having one. Also, I don't use the vacuum on carpet - just tile--- and it leaves clumps of dog hair behind because it didn't suck it up --- the pocket is pretty small too, i empty it once or twice a day because it gets ""clogged"", My floor isn't even dirty , its just to help suck up dog hair."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"It just works, and works well.","This vac replaced a Neato LIDAR unit that served us well for years but was just not picking up all the sand anymore. Despite lacking the LIDAR capability, it is like a blind man with a very good memory. It logically. and efficiently cleans the entire house-all 2000+ sq ft on a single charge. The low profile allows it to clean under furniture and it will calculate a pattern that provides for the brush to clean along all walls. To be clear, our house is all hard flooring so we cannot comment on how the unit cleans carpet, but after cleaning we can feel no sand or dirt. You will need a smart phone and home wifi network to access settings for the vacuum (many settings, such as vacuum power level, cannot be changed without using the app). With the coupon, at $200 it is hard to beat."
2.0 out of 5 stars,It‚Äôs OK,"Wanted to love this robot vac based on reviews and research, but for me it‚Äôs not hitting the mark. As for positives, there is a good amount of information provided on the app and the dust bin is pretty large. Other than that, I don‚Äôt love it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Realistic Expectations,"The only negative I have to say about this product is setting it up with Alexa is not easy. I gave up on that and strictly use the app. Other than that, it does what it is intended to do. The bad reviews, in my opinion, have unrealistic expectations of a robovac. These are not designed to replace mopping and sweeping. I use this to keep tidy between cleanings. I don‚Äôt expect this to do my deep cleaning for me. This keeps me from having to daily sweep dog hair and wipe muddy dog prints. I‚Äôm ok with that."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I was played /,"Roborock went above and beyond to correct this mistake for me , I am truly grateful. They reached out to me directly to make sure that I was able to purchase new equipment and even provided a discount. I tried out the new vacuum today and its amazing, really great vacuum."
1.0 out of 5 stars,Shockingly bad device.,"The app is absolute garbage. I spent an hour trying to get it connected. Ran through all of the troubleshooting scenarios online and still nothing. Reset the router, disabled all but 2.4ghz, and still nothing. I guess if you're willing to use nearly zero security on your home router this might work, but if you're buying a smart device you expect it to be smart. It's simply not the case. I'm returning this ASAP to buy an iRobot device. I know they work with normal WiFi configurations. The instructions also look like they were written by typing the words into Google translate and hoping for the best. They're close, but not quite there. Shockingly bad all around."
3.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn‚Äôt go home to charge,"I‚Äôve had this product for a few days now and have had it run every day. Whenever it gets to 20% battery and tried to go home, it never gets there. It seems to almost retrace it‚Äôs steps and always dies before it can get home. The suction is good and I am happy with the results of the vacuum. But I am not pleased with the fact that it will not make it home so I have to bring it home myself every time to charge. It thinks that dying is the end of the cleaning so it does not go back out once it has fully charged. It has cleaned the same few rooms over and over as it never truly finishes the cleaning. Will be returning and finding a different vacuum"
5.0 out of 5 stars,A smart vacuum with persistence,¬†This is the first robot vacuum I‚Äôve owned - the reviews always scared me away. I was intrigued by the house mapping and simplicity while maintaining good reviews.
2.0 out of 5 stars,Meh...  Works okay,"Bought an iRobot in 2017, loved it. Found this beauty to replace the worn out iRobot. Found this on a review of good robot vacuums for dog hair. It does some hair removal from carpet, but not much. Otherwise, on tile and hardwood it gets up most of the hair, though very slowly. It will go home and charge if it has not finished running its job for the day, but it charges for many hours before resuming. We have a 2,100 square foot house. The cleaning starts at 8:30 AM, pauses for charging and then resumes at around 6 PM. If you thought this would take care of the sweeping while you were at work, you are mistaken."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love the robo rock, life saver with a baby who eats everything on the floor.","The robo rock works great, it picks up all the small stuff, addresses corners and furniture really well. It also lets me know when it is time for cleaning the brushes... I just cut the hairs that are stuck with a scissors and it takes no more than 5 minutes. It also works great with Alexa. I take the dust out of the vacuum once every week and it is always full so that shows it is really picking up the dirt. I have a baby so really like the fact that it goes under the bed and furniture so I don‚Äôt have to move them."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I‚Äôm a BELIEVER!!!,"¬†Oh my goodness, this is the first one I have ever owned and I am an absolute believer. It‚Äôs very methodical in the way that it cleans and I absolutely love the app where I can see a floor plan of where it has cleaned, I can control it from the app, I can set up dates and times when it can automatically start cleaning, and you get notifications about any issues‚Ä¶ I just can‚Äôt say enough good about it. I‚Äôm not somebody who vacuumed my house that often because it seemedclean but now that I‚Äôve been running this every other day I can‚Äôt believe how dirty things are (and were) when you have two cats in the home. Works great on carpet, laminate, and vinyl flooring. One other funny little benefits of this vacuum is it helps me keep my house more clean because I really want it to be able to run while I‚Äôm in my office working or busy doing other things. Love love love. Buy this. I want two!!!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,OK already -  MAKE SURE PASSWORDS IS .! It‚Äôs now working - It‚Äôs great!!!,"Iphone, Samsung Galaxy S8., both unable to use any WFI control. I contacted customer service a d had a vert well spoken pleasant person but the APP Mi Home simply doesn‚Äôt connect the phones and vacuum cleaner."
4.0 out of 5 stars,Miracle on wheels,"Wow! I do not know what I did without this! Works great over the carpet and hardwood floors. It sure is a time saver and helper. I don't have it connected to wifi so whenever I want to use it, I press the button and there are no problems. It has gotten stuck a few times but I just move it and it goes on its way."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I love this vaccum!!,"I have arthritis and a bad back so, even though I have an excellent vaccum, it is hard to use it. I really did not have high expectations but because of the price, thought I would give it a try. I have hardwood and carpet and two dogs who shed soooo much. I didn‚Äôt know how to map the house but didn‚Äôt need to. I charged Sam (that‚Äôs his name) and sent him on his way. I followed him the first time. He vacuumed the whole house and went room to room ,under the bed, the dresser and night stands, and over throw rugs. I emptied him twice, it was full of dog hair. Now I just let him go. I highly recommend this vaccum."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Impressive!,"We had owned a Rumba about ten years ago and weren‚Äôt that impressed with it, but decided to try again given the newer technology. We have been nothing but thrilled with our Roborock E4. At first it felt intimidating to set it up with our phones, but we soon got everything connected and ‚ÄúOur Maid‚Äù began cleaning. She follows a back and forth pattern and easily transitions from our hard woods to our carpet. The app allows you to set your suction and noise preference. She cleans VERY well. We also purchased the mop extension and it‚Äôs good for a quick clean, but would need to be changed out or cleaned frequently for deep mopping. Basically there is just a wet pad that attaches to the back side of the vacuum so it drag mops as the vacuum is cleaning. So far the vacuum has been great for dog hair too and the app will tell you when the cartridge is full. We highly recommend this vacuum!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Best value/money cleaning robot as of May 2020; why buy top of the line? this one does it all!,"After doing some research online, I ended up choosing this model (Roborock E4). I mostly looked into Roborock and Roomba robots, and this one was by far the best bang for buck (as of May 2020; paid approximately $260, since there was some promotion due to this being a recent launch). Have been using it for a few days now, and am super happy with it. The navigation capacity works really well, even though the sensor suite isn't as powerful as compared to some of the more expensive models. Even when I leave it cleaning a separate floor (in which case it obviously cannot find the dock), it does a great job returning to the initial position. I'm super happy with this purchase. Congrats to the manufacturer for creating such an awesome product. Cleaning carpets no more!! :)"
5.0 out of 5 stars,It does better than even I expected!,"I have three Shetland Sheepdogs and a border collie/papillon mix puppy. As you can imagine, our house is overrun by fur! It has been frustrating that even though I vacuum frequently I could never seem to keep ahead of the fur! Even my Dyson Animal would not take care of it!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Totally Impressed,"I chose this product because I had 3 co workers that have the same model and swear by it. They were so excited by it I was finally convinced to pull the trigger on a robot vacuum. The only thing that's upsetting is that I waited this long! I can't believe the amount of crap this thing picks up. We live in the country and have 3 dogs and 2 kids. So far no problems and it just goes about its business and helps me keep our floors clean (we don't have any carpet in the house) Very easy to use, I got it on sale and highly recommend!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great value for the money!,"I got this as a gift for my Mom for Christmas this past year, she seems to love it!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,Vacuum cleaner does not work.,"After setting up the roborock cleaner, which took a few hours, we charged it overnight and then tried to clean. The robobot just went back and forth a few inches, turned around and did the same thing again. It also could not find the dock after tellig it to go back to the dock. I definitely would not recommend this product. Buy a brand name!!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Close to perfection, but no cigar","There is a lot that I love about this robot vacuum, but also so much that could be improved and that is disappointing."
5.0 out of 5 stars,It Works On My Open Floor Plan Home!,"I absolutely LOVE this vacuum. I had a Roomba, but even with the annoying battery-draining towers, it got confused and was more trouble than it was worth in my large home with open floor plan. Then it died. I was hesitant to buy another robot vacuum, but at this price point and in the hopes that technology has improved, I decided to give it a shot. Wow! My house has never been this clean. I have 3 dogs (one has long hair), two kids, and a husband who can not be trained to take his shoes off, so there‚Äôs always bits of fur and dirt being tracked everywhere and it just looks terrible unless I vacuum every day, and that‚Äôs just not realistic. This vacuum does fantastic on the hardwood floors (all of the main living areas are hardwood with a few area rugs). It does pretty well on the shorter-pile area rugs (it got tangled in my one high-pile area rug, so I just move it). I let it run every day, and it keeps everything tidy, even down the hall and into the mud room, and into the bedrooms if I leave the doors open. Even if I don‚Äôt let it in the bedrooms, those rugs are kept cleaner because we aren‚Äôt tracking stuff from the main part of the house into them. It finds the dock when it‚Äôs low on battery and then comes back out again to finish. It‚Äôs a little loud, but I‚Äôm getting used to hearing it in the background. I just put some music on so I can‚Äôt hear it. I never intended it to replace my normal vacuuming, just to keep things looking tidy in between. I actually don‚Äôt think I need to vacuum the hardwood floors at all anymore. It gets under and behind furniture and probably does a better job than I did anyway. I may get the attachment for the moping feature some day. The rugs will still need a proper vacuuming to get the deep dirt out, though the dust bin shows that it certainly is getting some of the deeper stuff out. I highly recommend this vacuum!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,I‚Äôm in love with you sweet gadget,Where have you been all my life sweet gadget! I finally gave into the hype and bought one of these when I was frustrated with my dirty floors during FTS o‚Äôclock. I‚Äôm so happy I did! It‚Äôs like a lovable family pet that cleans. If you have any tile or wood floors DO NOT buy this without the mop feature. It‚Äôs my favorite part!
4.0 out of 5 stars,Great for large homes and pet fur!,"I was always skeptical about robot vacuums and never thought they would get a ""good cleaning""... I was wrong. I am highly impressed on the suction of this vacuum. Attached photos it got 200 minutes before battery got to 10% as it was returning itself to docking and 178 sq. Meters which is equivalent to 1,900 sq feet. And who doesn't love vacuum lines?!? I havent used the mop feature yet, I just received this 3 days ago."
5.0 out of 5 stars,cleans well on concrete floors and rugs.,"So far this vacuum is doing a great job picking up dust, which is why I got it and it does a good job cleaning the small area rug that we have as well as the cat's litter mat. It gets under the bed which I was unable to do before. It seems to go over at least some areas, more than once so it is very thorough. When it finishes doing the floors, it goes back and does the edges of each room which is nice. We have stained concrete floors and live in the desert so this vacuum is a great help with the dust which will help with our allergies. I saw it on Amazon when it was on a special sale so I got a great price on it. I couldn't afford the 700 and 800 dollar price tag on other vacuums. I don't use the app that you can get with this. I just push the start button and it says ""starting cleaning"" and away it goes."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I haven't swept in a month!,We have had this about a month now. I LOVE it! For the price I think it is totally worth it. I have 2 dogs and live in the desert my floor constantly has dog hair and dust. Not to mention the two small kids.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Would recommend especially if you have dogs,"This vacuum is well worth the money! I bought it May 16, 2020 and have been more than pleased! I have 4 dogs that shed a lot and trying to keep up with the hair seemed almost impossible. It is set up to run once every day and when I get home the dust bin is always full. Today I ran my actual vacuum for the first time in 2 weeks and the canister was about half full, so it‚Äôs picking up the majority of the hair. It doesn‚Äôt just randomly drive around like the cheaper robot vacuums do it maps your house to a certain extent. It gets everywhere but usually goes over the house 2-3 times, which I don‚Äôt mind. I use to come home to dust bunnies along the hardwood floors but now it‚Äôs very clean thanks to the roborock."
4.0 out of 5 stars,Decent Vacuum when it works properly,"I got this about a month ago. At first it was fantastic, and really did a great job, however, after some time, now it starts to have all sorts of issues, it gets lost, it decides its ""done"" half way through cleaning despite having plenty of charge and I just had to order a package of replacement parts (filters, brush etc.) as the ones it came with didn't seem to last too long, just a few weeks of occasional use. i don't even have any pets, just regular household dust. It was great at first, but I don't think it will last too much longer. It's very expensive for a vacuum that has such a short lifespan. This is my first robot vac and it was so highly rated and on sale so I tried it...probably i made a mistake, I'll try to update this review at some point."
4.0 out of 5 stars,Little vacuum,"I do really like this vacuum. It runs for a long time and doesn't have trouble navigating the house. We have 3 dogs, 3 cats, AND a toddler and it picks up every hair and crumb! The directions were easy to follow, although it mentioned putting down the moisture pad for hard floors, that wasn't included with mine. There also was no remote, extra parts, or the mopping attachment, but I'm not sure if those were supposed to be included. Overall, this little robot is a serious trooper! I love that it talks to you as well and the timers are consistent and easy to set. I definitely recommend this to anyone who has a house that needs to be swept/vacuumed 3x a day. Save your back and buy this robot vacuum."
4.0 out of 5 stars,Works fine but...,"The E4 robovac has good suction and does a good job of covering the area it sweeps and then going back along the walls to get the edges of the swept area. HOWEVER, it will not sync with a Moto E5 Play android phone no matter what I do. In Bluetooth mode the phone does not see the E5 what so ever and, if I force the E4 to connect by brute force, it says ""connected but no internet"" even though the phone connects via wifi to the internet with no problem. The bottom line: the E4 works manually and does a reasonable job of cleaning the floor and exploring for rooms to clean but it ""sucks"" (pardon the pun) when it comes to connecting with an android phone which has been noted in other reviews."
5.0 out of 5 stars,One of the best purchases I have made! Great with pet hair!!,"This robot vacuum is AMAZING!!! ü§© So VERY helpful with decreasing the amount of hair and dirt on my floors. I have 2 cats (1 long hair and 1 short hair) and 1 Alaskan Malamute large dog that requires continuous grooming as he sheds hair like there is no tomorrow. As expected, I still have to dust and get the deep corners and under furniture but it prevents me from having to vacuum every day. You can also schedule it to vacuum while you sleep, so you wake up to less hair! I have rugs and hardwood floor, it gets it all and adjusts its suction to what floor it is on. One of the best purchases I have made!"
3.0 out of 5 stars,I would get the next version up,"So I have this as my second vacuum, and I have the V6 model for home"
1.0 out of 5 stars,Damages your house!!,"Update: this thing is garbage. Misses spots everywhere, random cleaning patterns and DAMAGES MY HOUSE!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for a budget robot vacuum! Definitely recommend!,"This is my first day using this vacuum. But it picked up about 80% of the debris on my floor. My floors were nasty, so I‚Äôm not surprised that some stuff was left behind. But I know that if I run this every day, that my floors will be perfect. It made its way around my whole house on its own, and never went to the same spot twice. It was very thorough in making sure it got everywhere possible. This was all without the app, because I couldn‚Äôt get it to connect to the WiFi. But I only run it when I‚Äôm home since I have a large dog and two cats who all like to pee on the floor, so this doesn‚Äôt bother me. I just turn it on and go about my day. I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a budget robot vacuum. Definitely lives up to the good reviews."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth it 100%,"If you have kids and pets and have the means to splurge on this, absolutely do it. I have a cat and a toddler with another baby on the way and this is a sanity saver for my husband and I. This little engine that could is impressive with it's cleaning skills and my cleaning standards are quite high. I have watched it several times to see if it would miss areas, especially as it manuevers around furniture, etc, and it has yet to miss a single spot. Just make sure you move cords, pick up toys, etc before you start it. The suction is powerful and this little overachiever will find things you didn't know were there....like items put behind your couch by your toddler."
2.0 out of 5 stars,Works! But damage walls,"Update, the robot still cleans but I noticed the damage it is causing to the wall skirting and it started to bang against the furniture, not worth the money."
1.0 out of 5 stars,Old model,Old model without good mapping software
4.0 out of 5 stars,Best buy for the money,"I thought robot vacuums were a waste of money. Then I bought the Deebot 500 because it was super cheap. I was surprised by how well it worked, but I needed something SMARTER. So, I returned it, did my research, and spent the extra $100 on the Roborock E4. I was not disappointed. This is the only robot I found under $450 that goes in a straight line Z pattern instead of bouncing around wildly, changes suction power when it comes onto carpet, and remembers where it left off if it has to recharge in the middle of the cleaning job."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great purchase on Amazon Deal of the Day!!,"I have a blind husband and four cats, so I was always worried about getting one of these and having something get sucked in that shouldn't be. I don't know how, but that doesn't happen. He (we named him Vic the Vacuum) can go over the cords that are under my adjustable bed with no issues. He even vacuums the base of the cat towers. I have a 2,700 square foot home and he did almost the whole house in one charge. Also, the cats stay out of the way but aren't scared of it like the are the big noisy push vacuum."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Big suctions and better than my expectation,"We were very skeptical at first, since it was on sale and I decided to give it a try. first time after we ran one cycle, we were so shocked at how much dust it was in the bin, I consider myself very clean, I vacuumed everyday and we never wear shoes inside the house, but this machine cleans so much dust under the sofa and bed, somewhere that my vacuum was hard to reach unless I move the furnitures out which is impossible thing to do. Noise is not as bad as I thought, now I ran this machine once a day and I only need to do touch up with my vacuum once a while, my house is definitely cleaner(I can tell by the water cleanness when I mop the floor). Extremely happy with the investment, the only thing I will do on my next machine is to buy with lidar function, it will help to clean the house faster. But again with under $200, I am very satisfied with the purchase!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great investment,"We've had this for a month now. We live with 3 cats in a 2 bedroom apartment. They all shed and track litter everywhere, but we only have had to run it daily for our floors and carpet to always look guest-ready. For a quick top to bottom maintenance cleaning, it's nice to be able to quickly dust off surfaces before the vacuum runs, knowing it'll take care of any debris on the floor. Just be careful not to leave any cat toys, clothes or other items which can get tangled in the brushroll (some cord loops are among them). Also check for wet spots before its scheduled cleaning. I like how it learns the layout of the rooms after a few days and cleans in an organized manner. An hour of cleaning only uses up 25% of its battery, and it does the job well. This is one of the best investments we've ever made, and fellow pet owners wouldn't regret buying it!"
3.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed!üò¨,I purchased this primarily to vacuum under the bed and the whole house. It suppposly has 200 minutes run time.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great machine,"Love it. Been resistant to try one of these. Just not convinced over the years, but I‚Äôm a believer now. I still can‚Äôt connect to WiFi, But my service kind of sucks. So I can‚Äôt blame the machine. But it runs easily and methodically with push of the button. The bin is large and can do my whole floor area. Even with 2 large dogs and 2 cats indoors it has no problem. I have to raise my rugs and I run it at night. Rugs bog it down and I‚Äôm not sure if that would drain the power. My rugs are easy to shake outside anyways."
3.0 out of 5 stars,Worth a try,"Overall - this little thing is pretty good. I‚Äôve used it for about 120 minutes and it has been quite the champ. The dust bin is a good size, the water tank - however - is this flat little structure that is hard to fumble with. That flat tank with a nice wide pad is a short fall. Generally, I am pleased with the product - but the one let down - see pic - is an app that is not only vague, but in Chinese. After restarts and reloads - no progress. Ordered a replacement and maybe that would help. When it works - it works well. This little issue, however, is a major impact."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Very effective with dog hair.  Mopping is decent.,"Absolutely the best purchase I have made in the last several years. We have two kids and a Golden Retriever who sheds incessantly. We have laminate floors and carpet, and this does a great job for both. The navigation is fairly effective and we never notice missed spots. It picks up ALL the dog fur and dirt/grass/small yard debris, leaving the laminate floors a pleasure to walk on barefoot. It finishes with a pass around the perimeter, which is 99.8% effective. Of course because of its round shape, it won't get all the dust in the very corners, but the suction is strong enough to pull all the dog fur out of the corners, leaving next to nothing."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Wish I‚Äôd Bought It Sooner,"I‚Äôve been on the fence about buying a robot vacuum for a year now. I researched models and never pulled the trigger because of the high cost on the advanced models, and not wanting to get a cheaper one only to discover it needed the more advanced features. Well, this went on sale for $200 and I bought it. It‚Äôs not fast and efficient like some more expensive models claim to be, but it gets the job done! We turn it on when we take our toddler upstairs for bed, and it goes about its business. It bumps its way back and forth across our floor. Speed doesn‚Äôt matter to me. Having a clean hardwood floor despite a toddler, a dog and a cat is well worth it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Good starter vacuum if not better,"This unit has been gold for me. I live in a 1100 square foot condo with basically 4 rooms, mostly carpet. I can run it twice a day because I can. It covers most areas. Or I just lock it into 1 room. The suction power is great. Yes, I will have to vacuum certain areas at times. Emailed support over missing remote, which the unit does not come with. They emailed me right back with the download smart phone app. I am disappointed will some of the bad reviews on this vacuum. Not seeing it. Maybe some of the bad reviews are just as fake as some of the good reviews. If you are looking for a vacuum to help out during the week it is well worth the money if your home is set up for it. Now if we can get a dusting drone, I will be set."
2.0 out of 5 stars,Long term = Junk,"This is my second Roborock vacuum. Both of them have had longevity issues. After a year, it would get an error every time it started, even with regular maintenance, it eventually quit working. It would almost get stuck on the base, turn a couple loops and quit. BOTH of my roborocks did the same thing! I'm done. I ordered the new roomba and so far, it's fantastic."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"Suction is great, vacs very well, but AI is awful","I bought this for my parents for Christmas, and they loved it...because they never had had one before. I had had another of the XiaoMi (previous to being branded RoboRock) and loved it, so when this one kept missing complete sections of the house, or getting stuck when there was no obstruction, or couldn't find its dock, or re-vac-ed the same place four times (I counted!)... I knew something was wrong. In the end, I ended up returning this and buying my folks a better model. So buyer beware- this is the cheaper Roborock for a reason. The not-Lidar functionality is just rubbish."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Best of the lot,"I bought this after buying and returning a Roomba which I trialed for a couple of months. The Roomba was alright, but cost $100 extra and would get stuck sometimes when transitioning from hardwood floor onto various rugs I have around my apartment. No such problems with the Roborock E4. For $100 less, you get so many great additional features like mopping, better mapping, and better controls. The E4 can be controlled with a joystick in-app or set to do an area clean (the area in immediate vicinity to where you place the robot). None of these features are available on the Roomba in the same price range. Roborock is the no-brainer choice."
4.0 out of 5 stars,Great power but not consistent Revised,"Update - My original review follows but I would like to brag on the customer support I have received with my issues. When I started having inconsistent issues with my E series robot, I reached out to support and they did not quit trouble shooting until I was finally satisfied. They honored their warranty and did repair a broken sensor. When the unit continued to have some issues, they explained that the unit was better suited to homes under 1500 sq ft. They upgraded my vacuum to the S series which has worked consistently again throughout my home. I highly recommend the Roborock S4 for larger homes. I am giving them 4 stars today because of their excellent service."
3.0 out of 5 stars,Won‚Äôt connect to the app,Same problem as all the others. Won‚Äôt connect to the app. I contacted customer support. They sent me a list of things to try to resolve the problem. I consider myself pretty good with computer's but one instruction on the list you have to be a computer genius to accomplish.
4.0 out of 5 stars,Works as a daily lightweight vacuum.,"It has enough suction power for light daily pickup of dust and debris, works well. It does not pick up what my larger Shark vacuum does but I‚Äôm ok with that. I live in desert AZ and we get lots of fine dust snd this works great. I just take out the shark once a week for my carpets and areas robo rock can‚Äôt reach. I am very pleased. It took three dock relocations before I found the ideal place so that it now will clean my whole house. Previously it did not and had a hard time finding the dock when it would finish its cleaning. I am happy with the purchase."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Super great for the money and really easy to clean/detangle,"Bought this on a whim during a lightning deal and I am so glad I did. Keeps my living room (which has vinyl plank) and kitchen (tile) clean and doesn't damage curtains/rugs etc. (I have a jute rug though and it picks up some of the natural fibers/grit in the rug). Extremely easy to clean out/take apart which I appreciate, as I usually have a ton of hair that wraps around the wheels/agitator of other vacuums and it can be a pain to cut out. With this, you can remove both the dust bin and the roller/agitator that sweeps up gunk - you can also unscrew the side brush for further easy detangling. Love it!!!"
2.0 out of 5 stars,Dirty little sucker...,"Not so thrilled with this vacuum... first turnoff after unboxing was that it looked as though it had been used. But that was the least of my concerns. Second turnoff was the app to download which was clearly a Chinese app and looked very sketchy. Couldn‚Äôt get it to work with Alexa, and the vacuum simply missed a bunch of spots as I watched it work several times in a row. I went against my better judgment and should have bought the iRobot."
5.0 out of 5 stars,It's fantastic!,"I love this vacuum cleaner, it does a superb job of cleaning, and battery life is great!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Tiny but mighty,"¬†I have a dog, a cat, and 2 small children. Pet hair, crumbs, and dirt are never ending in my house. I decided to finally try a robot vacuum since most of our floors are hardwood and the broom just wasn‚Äôt cutting it. I was SHOCKED at how well this vacuum cleans my floor. It‚Äôs great because my kids love watching it work so now they help pick up their toys, shoes, etc. off the floor so they can start the vacuum. I‚Äôm also amazed by how much the dust bin holds. The only downside is that it can‚Äôt do stairs üòÇ I plan to purchase another one. So I‚Äôll have one for upstairs and one for downstairs"
4.0 out of 5 stars,Let it do its thing,"Just have a little patience. I read the reviews and even made a spreadsheet to determine which model in this price range ($240-270) was best. The suction on this thing is far superior to other models of similar cost. And it have carpet boost!! But, you have to have a little patience because the first few times it runs, it is learning your house. So the vacuum runs around, testing boundaries and mostly cleaning but also looking lost and covering the same area multiple times. On the fourth day, it cleaned efficiently and got back to its dock quickly. (Yes, I have less than 4 days worth of patience.)"
3.0 out of 5 stars,"Robot is fine, but the App has died, robot unaccesible as a result.","All,"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Upgrade from Deebot 500,"Unbelievable! It was able to clean the entire first floor (approx. 1200 square feet). And let me tell you...trust it to do the entire floor...just when you think it ""forgot"" to get a section...it will do the whole thing. Love the ""Z"" pattern too! This was an upgrade from my Deebot 500...which was good...but this does the entire first floor on one charge. Love it!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Easy to use, quiet, and a great price!!","So easy to use and relatively quiet. I am able to watch TV watch being annoyed as it works. My only complaint is that it gets stuck in places and cannot return to base. In fact, it‚Äôs never returned to base after each cycle because it seems to get stuck in one location or another. I always have to pick it up and return it to its base. Despite this, I really love it and it‚Äôs definitely saved me a lot of work ‚Äì especially from having to clean under furniture that I cannot easily reach. In addition, the price is amazing for The product. No reason to buy a Roomba when this product is just as good if not better!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Don‚Äôt Need a Roomba!,"This vacuum is one of the best purposes I‚Äôve ever made! I bought a house with a bunch of wood floors and with my cat, I just couldn‚Äôt keep up, cleaning all the surface area. This little guy is a smart vacuum. It‚Äôs not very loud, strong suction, large dust bin for its size, love that I can use an app to control it. The most impressed I was with it was when it went back into my closet to clean! It has turbo (pick up speed over carpet) which is impressive too. I don‚Äôt know how it compared to a Roomba, but the price was excellent for the quality and Roomba are really expensive. Absolutely love it."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"Works well enough, attempts to harvest personal data","Does an adequate job, requires unwarranted access to wifi and personal data in order to schedule cleanings"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Clean up,"The machine has been run 13 times and done pretty good. With two dogs and tile everywhere I was constantly sweeping. Download app, press clean and away it goes. To start bumped pretty hard into Stuff a few times but I‚Äôd say camera works pretty well at avoiding that. Once it knows the machine is good at knowing where the stuff is. Just watch the path first time make sure it gets over and under everything alright. He got stuck under dishwasher and bar cart so just needed to adjust those barely. Every time the machine is done the dust bin is full. I love it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Very impressed for the price,Very impressed with this robo vac for such a low price. The batter life is incredible. I think the specs say 90 minutes but mine has lasted well over 2 hours on a single charge. I have hardwood and carpet and it does a great job on both. We have two long haired dogs and a cat so picking up pet hair is a top priority. This does a great job. The hair doesn‚Äôt constantly get wrapped around the main brush like another brand that I‚Äôve used. You do still have to untangle the hair from the brush occasionally but not often. Overall very happy with this purchase. I bought another for my upstairs.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth the money,¬†I was very hesitant on buying a robot vacuum but I must say this vacuum is the best. I also bought stop strips so it will avoid certain areas and extra filters. I have a dog that sheds quite a bit and the vacuum cleans it up easily. I'm pleasantly surprised how well it cleans.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Roborock E4 does it all ! 1 less chore to keep up on ! Highly recommend this robo vacuum!!,"Love love love üíï this Roborock E4 vacuum! Picks up scattered cat litter after they do their business and run out the crap shack. The vacuum picks it up without issue on hard wood floors. On day one it mapped out my house which I could see and follow on the Mi Home app. Easy to hook up to Wifi with the instructions provided. Recommend the app so you can program the robo v to clean any time of the day you choose and if you want to play with the routes you have a joystick to tell it where to go, but I love watching it does it‚Äôs own thinking and mapping out the room. Almost like it has a personality while it does it‚Äôs job. No more coming home everyday to manually sweep and / or vacuum because this Roborock gets it done for you. Highly recommend! Right now there‚Äôs a great deal on it too price wise. Highly recommended!!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Sucks as hard as 2020,"I adore this robot. I have it scheduled to begin cleaning one hour after I start working. Every morning when I hear it start up, I scramble from my work station to pick up all the socks and cats it may menace. It doubles so nicely as a work break."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Download Mi Home app, not Roborock app","Used like 4 times for the first week already. Perfect for my two small bedroom apartment. Two stories, but I have no problem carrying it up and down the floors (carpet upstairs, hardwood downstairs. It detects ‚Äúcliffs‚Äù so no need to worry about falling)"
4.0 out of 5 stars,Floor robot,I like that it‚Äôs quite. I like that it has no problem going from tile floor to area rug with no problem and that it switches over higher suction. It has a nice long battery life. My husband like that he can see a map of where it‚Äôs vacuum and read the error codes on his phone. To me a that‚Äôs a fun extra that I‚Äôm not interested in. We have only had it a few days but have ran it every day. It seeems to be getting smarter. Two things I don‚Äôt care about it is we have sliding doors and when they are open it drives itself over the edge and the recorded voice is all the way up and she‚Äôs still very quite.
5.0 out of 5 stars,So far so good,"I was skeptical!! I‚Äôve wanted a robot vacuum for a while and finally took a chance. It seems to get more up than I expected, it does take longer than I expected also, which is why I‚Äôm glad I can turn it on while at work and not have to listen to it. It is a little loud but not as loud as a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù vacuum cleaner. I haven‚Äôt used the mop function yet as I have area rugs and don‚Äôt feel like pulling them up but I love the vacuum function! Photo is from one vacuum and I consider my house clean!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Best bang for buck,"Love this vacumn! Has a basic GPS so it knows where it's been unlike most that just ping pong around until the battery dies, going over the same place repeatedly and missing other spots. Sent back a Roomba that wouldn't go on my area rug due to a few black stripes in the pattern, sent that one back and got this for half the price and it works flawlessly. The only negative with this brand is that you have to use the mihome app if you want to control it with your phone, and the app is total garbage. Constantly boots you out and loses your device. Hopefully they eventually come up with their own app."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Better than I could‚Äôve hoped.,I got this for Christmas and it is by far my favorite thing. We have a ton of sand coming in the house as we recently built and still don‚Äôt have rock for the driveway. I was worried the vacuum wouldn‚Äôt pick it up but it does. I also have a girls with really long hair so I was worried about being able to clean out the roller. I can‚Äôt tell you how many vacuum belts I‚Äôve broken because of that. This think is soooo easy to clean. The brush comes all the way out so it easy for me to cut the hair from around it. I have had some difficulty using the app but I‚Äôm not all that worried about it right now. I like running it while I‚Äôm home just in case it runs over little toys left behind by my 8 year old.
1.0 out of 5 stars,not worth it....,"Honestly, just don't waste your money on this. I have no idea if it is the brand or just this model, but this thing has been a disappointment for the last 10 months that I've owned it. It disconnects from the wifi randomly, doesn't clean the whole house consistently and returns to the dock after only 1/2 finishing one room. It is completely unreliable. The actual vacuum function when it is cleaning seems reasonable, but overall I would never recommend this to anyone. Unfortunately I wasted $300....don't make the same mistake. I'm sure there are similar robot vacuums in the price range that would be a much better buy than this."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Best. Thing. Ever!,"I don‚Äôt usually write reviews unless something is terrible or more than I expected. This vacuum is THE. BEST. THING. EVER! We bought a roomba like 5 years ago, but returned it because it was stupid. Went over the same spots 20 times, while simultaneously dancing around visible debris. I was hesitant to buy another one, but I‚Äôm a busy mom with a toddler, golden retriever, and 2 cats.... needless to say our floors need to be cleaned daily. The Z pattern of this machine in a huge improvement over the random pattern systems. It‚Äôs methodical, and hits every inch of the floor without wasting time going over the same spots many times. It also has multiple suction levels you can set. Some reviews complained about setup being difficult. I had no problem. I did however watch a YouTube unboxing video first in preparation for setup being difficult, so maybe that helped? It also has the ability to work as a moping system if you buy the attachments. It‚Äôs in my list to purchase. Overall this is my favorite purchase to date and believe everyone needs one!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,The CLEAN-I-MATER!,"This product simply NEVER stops! It is supposed to clean a regular house, but it easily tackled a dance studio of over 5,300 square feet! The programming is tricky, so be careful to follow instructions. The mop will keep a hardwood floor clean, but won't tackle tough spots unless you tell it to spot clean. Purchase freely. It will do far more than you ask of it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for Daily Dirt and Litter,"This vacuum is great for cleaning up the daily dirt in the house. I've got tile that's dark and light patterned which in the dark, the vac sometimes detects as cliffs. Keeping the lights on in the darker areas of the house and opening the curtains seems to solve it pretty well. The z pattern sort of works but it definitely gets a bit lost sometimes, though it usually finds its way eventually and does manage to vacuum everything."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Very pleased,I've been using the robot for about 2 months and I'm very happy. First we have two levels hard floors home and two kids of 2 and 5 years old.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great addition to my S4,"Great vacuum. I already had a Roborock S4 for downstairs and opted for the E4 for upstairs. The mapping feature was not that important for the upstairs application, but it makes a huge difference downstairs with all the furnishings, rugs, etc. Unless you have a nice open area, and mapping is not relevant, the E4 is great. Otherwise spend the extra $100 and go for the S4."
1.0 out of 5 stars,Too much for not enough,I wish I could return this item and get money back.
2.0 out of 5 stars,LIES!!!,"The Roborock E4 is NOT supported by the Roborock app, but will run using the MiHome app. However, MiHome vacuum is NOT an Alexa skill - and will NOT control the device. I bought this vacuum specifically because the description states it works with Alexa, and it DOES NOT. The vacuum itself is a quality product - but I was attempting to run all my ‚Äúsmart‚Äù devices in my home through a single source (Alexa). I am so disappointed because other than the deceptive product description, the vacuum itself is fantastic."
3.0 out of 5 stars,So far‚Ä¶meh.,"This thing works pretty well when there is nothing in its way. I even removed all my dining chairs and rawhide rugs to give it an easier first clean, but it still had issues. I have. 1300 square foot 1929 bungalow with hardwood floors. I would expect it wouldn‚Äôt be a difficult home to navigate, but I kept having to pick it up as it got stuck. I‚Äôll give it another couple tries before I send it back. Once it‚Äôs on track it cleans fairly well but did miss a few clumps of dog hair."
3.0 out of 5 stars,This thing is so confused,"Cleans amazing. Gets lost and cleans the same spot over and over. I still haven‚Äôt been able to connect to my phone, although I wouldn‚Äôt trust it to do anything without me here anyway. It does clean really great though so I‚Äôll give it that. My friends come over and talk about how great it cleans compared to their brands. I just wish it had more order to its cleaning plan if that makes sense."
5.0 out of 5 stars,My animals are skeptical... but I love it.,"I‚Äôm so happy with this vacuum! It‚Äôs really effective. I bought this because I have a German Shepherd mix and a fluffy cat, so our floors are often covered in cat and dog hair. I can‚Äôt vacuum every day, but the floors need to be cleaned every day. The vacuum gets our whole home in a little over an hour. It cleans in a linear fashion and leaves pleasing lines on our carpet. I have to dump the dustbin after every clean, which is satisfying when you see how much animal hair it cleans up."
5.0 out of 5 stars,So far so good.,"Fast delivery and nice unit. Have had for a few weeks and the battery lasts long enough to do our ranch house where we let it run. The dust bin is showing it is picking up a lot of dust and debris. Unit is quieter than our older Neato and runs longer. I like the APP so we can see what it did and now long it ran. The Wifi drops every once in a while so I have to reboot the router and then it will auto reconnect, not sure if its my router or the vacuum."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Little Robot Vacuum,"¬†I've had this robot vacuum for 2 months now, and it's been great. It can clean the vinyl plank, tile, and rugs in my open living room, dining room, and kitchen without any problems. It can also easily climb over our large transition pieces. It's relatively quiet and takes about an hour to clean a 900 square ft area. Most of the time it can find its way home. It occasionally gets stuck on the corner of my sofa, but overall I'm very happy with it."
4.0 out of 5 stars,Add Roborock home to your Alexa App,Overall really impressed by the movement and power that comes from this vacuum. It definitely picked up a bunch of dust and hair that I never knew existed (my fianc√©e and I clean every Sunday too). What was misleading was the mapping apparently the e series is not a part of the roborock app and has a separate app called mi home. Although that would have been a nice feature for $213 including tax not really gonna fret over it. If you want to add Your e series robot to Alexa download the roborock home app instead to connect the device. Happy dust hunting in your home.
3.0 out of 5 stars,Great vacuum but nearly useless with little remote control and NO mapping features,"First off, I love this vacuum as a vacuum, and I'm not happy I have to return it and upgrade to the S-Series, but that's how happy we are with the basic cleaning features. I owned a Roomba years ago, and enjoyed it, but when it died I let it go because it was a good experience but the little bin that was hard to remove and it's mindless approach just made it not worth the work. This E4 is light-years beyond that unit, and we've enjoyed it so much we'll stick with Roborock and spend the extra $ to get what we need."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great robot vacuum,"It works great when you leave it alone & let it do it's job. The remote with app is kind of difficult to control though. The general clean (the default choice) covers the entire floor, room to room. It can't clean the corners due to its round shape but it covers 98% of the floor space & cleans well."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Seriously manufacturers, just throw a remote in the box!","I am in hell trying to set this up. It‚Äôs not connecting through the phone and the Wi-Fi so the only thing It will do is spot clean which means it runs around in circles for a few seconds and then just goes off. Day 3 of trying‚Ä¶.I have never been so miserable in my life trying to make something work. Even if it does now and everything gets fixed, I‚Äôll hate it for a long time because of this misery. Total opposite of the purchase plan. Waiting a long time for this machine. Gutted."
5.0 out of 5 stars,It sucks up more fur in one run than I swept up in 4 weeks of sweeping.,"This vacuum works well and doesn't have a problem with our two area rugs. With two fur babies and a bad back it does well enough to keep me from sweeping every other day. It gets stuck going under our sectional and we move our dinning room chairs if we want the entire area rug vacuumed. It sucks up more fur in one run than I swept up in 4 weeks of sweeping and the noise level compared to a regular vacuum is nothing. I have a hard time opening the box that collects the dust and fur due to arthritis, others may not have this issue."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"Good, not great.","It does the job, you do expect more from it since it's advertised that it can do much. The remote control is too glitchy, it lags when you press the button and sometimes it just does not work. Have thought much about returning it because of this; I also purchased a Coredy robot and its remote on the app works flawlessly with its immediate response. I thought since this is more of a ""well known"" brand it would perform better, but a little disappointed there. It has gotten stuck under the cabinets at times, the Coredy knows how to get out of the situation. Maybe I should spend a little more and get a ""better"" performing robot. I will definitely update this review if I do."
3.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth the money,"Waited to review this till after 6 months of use. Actually has been more than 6 months. The unit stops in the middle of a room and asks to clear obisticles but there's nothing remotely close to the unit. It only cleans 1/4 of the room and says it's finished cleaning and going back to the dock. There are a lot more issues but these to us were enough. We clean the unit after every use so it's not a matter of maintenance, the unit just isn't worth the money. Buyer please beware, this review is not an emotional one, but one of facts."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"So far, so good",I purchased this vacuum to help me keep up with the amount of dog hair in our home. I just don't have the time to sweep daily and I was hoping this vacuum would help.
1.0 out of 5 stars,It‚Äôs not worth the wifi headache,I followed the instructions and was not able to get it to work. I tried several times to get it to connect with wifi.. Very frustrating ..uugh
5.0 out of 5 stars,Makes my life easier,"¬†I was skeptical when I bought this, however, it was one of the best purchases that I've ever made. This little vacuum does a great job. It gets pretty close to the edges and transitions well from rug to hardwood. I like that it doesn't clean in a random pattern line some robot vacuums. I would advise doing a quick walk through of the area that is about to be cleaned and pick up any obstacles that could cause it to get stuck. I like to put my kitchen chairs up to get a good clean under my table."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Quiet,"Our first vac was a 700 series Roomba. The Roborock is soooooo much quieter. It is easier to clean the than Roomba. The battery runs for a very long time almost to long! E4 is very gentle when it ‚Äúruns into‚Äù legs of tables unlike the Roomba. Cons: Have to go online to get directions for use and programming. The directions to program are so confusing that I have elected not to program an auto start.There may also be a way to program it to run in only a certain area, but again the directions are so confusing that I didn‚Äôt program that feature. Works great for the money, wish I understood the programming instructions better to get full benefit of all features. I would buy this again."
5.0 out of 5 stars,THE BEST THING I'VE EVER SEEN!!,"WOW!! It's Amazing, it Truly Is! This is OUR BEST CLEANER WE HAVE!! One, it does ALL the work for you. Go do something else for a change!!! 2. It gets up more dirt than our larger vacuum cleaner!! 3. It's so thin, it cleans all under beds!! Where most vacuums never go!! You wouldn't believe how much this little guy picks up. It goes from our hard wood floors to carpet with no problems! Heck YES I RECOMMEND THIS!! GET IT. IF YOU HAVE DUST ALLERGIES LIKE ME, THIS IS FOR YOU, SERIOUSLY!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great little robot, including for dog owners!","This robot is awesome for the price! After having tried two others over the last few years (one much more expensive ...), which constantly got stuck on rugs and in corners, I was pleasantly surprised with this one. It's smart enough to try various movements to get unstuck from rolled up rugs or electric cords. The suction is decent and manages to clean up dog hair reasonably well (including a Husky Malamute mix hair...). Where another robot I had in the past would constantly get hung up on rugs, this one is heavy and large enough to crawl on top without much difficulty. It also has enough of a mapping function to not miss areas, despite furniture and dog beds in many places. All around, I am very happy with this robot!"
3.0 out of 5 stars,Mop stopped working after two months,"As a vacuum, this thing is amazing. Having cats in the house, it drove me crazy to clean daily because of all the lingering fur... but not anymore."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great value, quality cleaning job, gets lost and scared sometimes","Overall, we're really happy with this purchase! We have all hardwood floors and two cats and it keeps everything clean: it easily goes under chairs and beds no problem. The battery life holds out longer than two hours, which is about how long it takes to clean our 1200 sq ft house. The dust bin is easy to remove and the app is really intuitive. Sometimes if it gets stuck or you have to pick it up and put it somewhere though, it re-sets its cleaning map and gets very confused. It also doesn't actually learn your layout, so a lot of the time spent is bumping into things every time, and sometimes it gets lost and calls for help (but don't we all do the same thing at some point or another in the godforesaken world?). It's not super loud but can be a little distracting if you're in the same room and trying to work. More distracting than a cat, but less distracting than a child. If it's more than 10 feet away from the dock when it's done cleaning you will definitely have to help it along: ours is slowly gaining confidence, though. Easily transitions from hardwood to rugs and the suction on it is really impressive: it easily picks up large particles like cat food (Rachel Ray Nutrish is its favorite...the salmon kind). Overall, would definitely recommend this for someone who wants a good robot vacuum/family member without spending over $500."
4.0 out of 5 stars,Great product!,"The vacuum itself is very good for the price, but there's a thing that prevent me from loving it completely: No Google Home integration whatsoever? Come on!"
2.0 out of 5 stars,Worked well for about a week.,"I really love that I don't have to vacuum with a robot vac, so I was pleased with this the first week. Although it did look really banged up after the first time I used it...it bumps into things harder than you would think. This is the 2nd week I've used it, and I've noticed a steep decline. The suction doesn't seem to be as good, I have to switch to the remote control to get it to go over places it missed, it get's lost when returning to the base, error code about the wheels being blocked (they weren't), and do not trust this to not fall down stairs even though it's supposed to sense that and avoid it. Thankfully, I caught it before it fell. I do like that it goes in a more logical pattern than some of the cheaper ones, but I wouldn't recommend this for the price. It's probably worth it to spend a little more to get a much better bot."
5.0 out of 5 stars,So awesome,So far I love it. Our dog is not so sure though. but I just want to let people know that if you have a Google 5 GHz mesh Wi-Fi it works just fine. I'm not sure why some people say that it only works on 2.4. I didn't have any issues connecting and my phone clearly states that I'm on a 5 ghz wifi right now. I noticed that it created its own Wi-Fi network and it connected to that. Not exactly sure how that worked but maybe that's the reason.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent product,"I love this product and it has great suction power. Makes my carpets look beautiful all the time. I think this is my all time favorite Christmas gift I have ever received. I would say the one difficulty for this product is getting it to go where you want it to. I have a sleigh bed and it does go under the bed. We did order the magnet strips (but that gets expensive). We used the bed legs to hold down the magnet strips, but if you have other areas that it can go under, it could present a problem. Most of my home doesn't have furniture that the vacuum can get under."
1.0 out of 5 stars,App is terrible,The robot vacuum runs on the Mi Home app which is terrible. I‚Äôve had the vacuum for 4 months and the vacuum will not run according to schedule of it is disconnected from WiFi. The problem is that it disconnects all the time and requires extensive troubleshooting to reconnect. A terrible App completely reduces this robot vacuum to the most basic version. I can only manually press the button now to run the vacuum. I regret buying this product.
2.0 out of 5 stars,Won‚Äôt vac area rugs with black patterns!,"I wanted to like this. The idea of SOMEONE ELSE vacuuming? Yes please. And every day? My dream come true. I have hardwood floors and 3 pets. This thing was great at that. I was impressed. But the second it hit my dark doormat and black patterned area rug, it freaked out. Wouldn‚Äôt vacuum. And apparently was so distraught that it barfed the contents of its dustbin all over the rug. I‚Äôm not even sure how it did that! I went online for a hack and tons of other people had this prob. I covered the cliff sensors as they reco‚Äôd. And then it wouldn‚Äôt vac at all and kept telling me to clean the cliff sensors. I finally gave up and sent it back. Other than that it was incredibly easy to set up and did a nice job on hardwood."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"Vacuum works great, but they sent me the wrong unit.",Update: This vacuum worked great for about 3 months. Then it just got confused. Started charging for 10 minutes then leaving the dock. Then it would clean for about 3 minutes then just stop. I am returning it for a new one.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great value for the $,"I‚Äôve had the Roborock E4 for almost 1 month so far & I love it! It vacuums in straight lines, great suction power & easy to clean. The app is easy to use as a remote & Alexa can start/ stop the vacuum. I have 1 young child, a dog with short hair & a wood burning stove that puts a lot of dust in the air. I use it every day or every other day to pick up hair, dirt & dust."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Pretty good for the price. Could not use with Alexa, but could link to Google Home.","First ran the vacuum without WiFi. Cleaned fairly well, but the without WiFi it's inconvenient to control. Tried to link to Alexa for hours, but unsuccessful. Although the manual does not mention Google Home, I found it easy to control with Google Home and Mi Home. Can monitor the vacuum and control easily. Even got voice control to work with Google. Can also see a map of cleaned area after cleaning session completes. Looks like will run for about 2 hours on a battery full charge. The dustbin filled up when the battery was at 52%. Cleaning is often and a little painful. Full charging is fairly slow (3-4 hours). I love to watch it vacuum....it's pretty smart. Goes under most items, but not all. I haven't tried mopping yet."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Addition to Our Home,"I‚Äôve had the Robo for about 3 weeks now. I have to say I am completely satisfied with the job it is doing on my dark kitchen floor. I use it almost everyday and it does an efficient job. I followed it around the first couple of times. It got wedged under the dishwasher so I put a rolled up rug under the dishwasher. It works fine on low pile rugs. I was a little worried about the edges of my oriental, but it‚Äôs fine. It can‚Äôt handle the higher pile rug in my dining room. It gets clogged with fuzz so I vacuum that myself. All in all, very pleased."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Her name is Roxxy. She. Is. Dope!!,"First off. Her name is Roxxy. Second. She‚Äôs the best. The family has been enamored by our little robo buddy. She talks. And obeys. She comes out at 9 am Monday Wednesday fri. And 9 pm sat and sun. She starts out with. ‚ÄúStarting cleaning‚Äù and ends with‚Äù cleaning complete, going back to dock‚Äù and I get a text on my phone. It watch. Love it. We‚Äôve followed her about. And she goes EVERYWHERE you‚Äôll allow. Nvm ever gets stuck. And the app tell you how she‚Äôs doing as far as maintenance. We bout the 15 dollar extra parts pack. With rollovers and filters. By my estimates. I won‚Äôt need to buy parts for at least two years. I‚Äôm thinking of getting one for upstairs. But I caught it on sale ($188) and really don‚Äôt want to buy another at 269. Buy am thinking about it. If I do. Her name will be Rosie.......Roxxy is super quiet. Barely louder than a normal vac. If that. And she‚Äôs SMART! We watched her navigate the world with amazement. If you want a great vac that won‚Äôt break the bank. Get it. My only issue. Is I can‚Äôt get google home to play nice on my iPhone. Lol. Imagine that?"
2.0 out of 5 stars,It is possible to feel pity for an inanimate object?,After the cheap little Eufy robovac had an unfortunate accident I decided it was time to upgrade to something more advanced. After hours of research and the Prime Day offers I came upon the Roborock vacuums. Great packaging and everything seemed to be in order.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Crazy awesome,Really like the way this thing cleans my hardwood and carpets. I am old school about cleaning. But this lil bull dog goes places I can‚Äôt so I have added this to my old school cleaning. I am shocked how much dirt is pulled up by this vacuum very happy with it
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great investment,"I bought 2 of these at the same time, one for a relative. I had previously purchased a different brand, so was concerned that this wouldn't work as well. I couldn't believe how well it works! While it doesn't have the ability to map your area, it is very thorough. It goes back and forth, overlapping where it had just vacuumed. It also has a few brushes that stick out a little for corners. It spent an hour in our bedroom, with alot under the bed, which is where I never vacuum. Cleaning it out is very easy. Best investment and I highly recommend. I got ours on a black Friday sale and saved $100."
4.0 out of 5 stars,Great vacuum for the price,"Very good vacuum for the price. It will keep going over the same area multiple times, not sure of to get it completely clean or a flaw in the system but in general happy with this vacuum. They also have great responsive customer service, I asked for a couple of pieces there the manual started come with the vacuum but were not in the box and they sent it to me within a week. Thank you!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing job so far!,Just ran this for the first time before bed last night. It is a little noisy while in the same room. I turned it down to silent and it still made noise. I have all hardwood and tile floors so it may contribute to the noise. I woke up this morning and my floors looked so good! My dogs shed a ton and kids leave dirt everywhere. I shared a photo of the dust bin. The device was back on its charger safely. It navigated under my beds and didn‚Äôt fall down the stairs. I am so excited about this device!!
3.0 out of 5 stars,"Started off strong, but after 2 months things have changed,","The vacuum started out really strong and was working great, but after 2 months the thing looks like it‚Äôs been through WW2 and seems noisier while operating. It has paint scrape marks all over it and the speaker goes in and out when announcing. When we first got it, it never got stuck but now it gets stuck almost every day. I come down in the morning to find it stuck under the lip of our kitchen cabinets or on our daughters play mat. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs lost it‚Äôs steam or it‚Äôs just not built for our house, but getting stuck under our cabinets seem to be the biggest issue. The little ‚Äúeye‚Äù that pops out the top always get stuck under the cabinet lips. I wouldn‚Äôt buy again."
2.0 out of 5 stars,Not for pets who shed alot,"I bought this model based on a 10 min video comparing several different models, sadly disappointed to say the least. I have new base boards and now I have a permanent mark from the vaccum a ring around the perimeter if you will. Says great for dog hair I have 2 dogs 1 who sheds ridiculous amounts of hair he should be bald. The 1 brush just flips the hair right out the back of the unit. I have 3 cleaning times set per day to cover all the dog hair and I still have to use a dust mop after the vaccum is done. It gets caught under the couch every time it pushes it way under there, so much for it scanning the room to learn the obstacles in the way. Some days it finds home right away but other day it needs assistance.. i do like the app very easy to use, however it was a rough start to sync it to the wifi had to Uninstal it. This models doesn't come with any extra brush filter all sold separately. The back and forth pattern is great no issues there. Like the talking feature and notifications from the app. Overall I wouldn't recommend this model for people who have pets or furniture to many obstacles in its path. Also its loud you can't hear the TV while it running."
3.0 out of 5 stars,It gets lost a lot,"It's great to have a machine that picks up so much dirt, but there have to be others out there that work better. This one gets lost and redoes rooms, sometimes 4 or 5 times. It announces that it is low on battery power and returning to dock, but continues cleaning. When it gets trapped it has a terrible time getting itself out of the trap even--can't seem to figure out how to go backwards. It also takes a very, VERY long time to recharge."

1.0 out of 5 stars,Don‚Äôt waste your money,I have had this for approx 2 months and keep getting more and more disappointed. The suction is not what is claimed. I have watched this vacuum roll over dog hair and the hair is still there after it goes directly over it I‚Äôve watched it roll over oatmeal that was spilled not wet oatmeal dry oatmeal flakes and watched it roll right over and leave the flakes there so to me that means there is no suction. Bummed I spent so much on something that doesn‚Äôt perform satisfactorily.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great value and works well,I am very happy with this item. It cleans well and the battery lasts long enough for the area that I need cleaned to be done in one pass through. The only problem that I have had is with the Alexa app as I can't seem to get this connected.
1.0 out of 5 stars,Terrible And frightened for my family...,"I order this and it was shipped out like the picture you see this is unexceptable, I hope that we where not exposed to any germs..."
3.0 out of 5 stars,Buena pero solo como apoyo a mantenimiento de lo que t√∫ limpias,"Ayuda solamente para mantener limpio, no es un equipo para usar como sustituto de la limpieza profunda, el mapeador es bastante deficiente, como menciono, solo para mantener limpio el piso despu√©s de que una persona haya hecho una limpieza profunda, NO SUSTITUYE AL SER HUMANO, si tu expectativa es no hacer m√°s T√∫, te va decepcionar, por los costos que tienen creo que no valen la pena a√∫n pagar mas de 100 o 150 dls, pagu√© 250 y creo que fu√© mucho para la rentabilidad en el uso"
1.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth the money!!,When I first purchased this product and used it it worked fine. Then it would not perform like it did. It would just do irratic stuff. It would not cover the whole area anymore. Then it would just stop in the middle of cleaning.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Give it time!,"So far so good! We've been using our little robot that I've named R2 for a few days now. The first day, it seemed confused as it was learning the layout of our home. It had difficulty learning where its docking station was. Its finally figured out most of our floor plan 5 days later and goes straight home when I tell it to dock."
3.0 out of 5 stars,It does not pick up as well on carpet,"I have hardwood floors with one area rug in my living room & it does a great job on hardwood floor but does not pick up on area rug. I have a Chihuahua & of course I have a lot of dog hair but this Roborock does not pick up the dog hair at all on rug. This is one main reason I chose this one as it advertised it does a good job of picking up dog hair. I‚Äôm very displeased for this reason. I have back trouble and it‚Äôs very hard for me to push a vacuum cleaner so I thought this would be the answer, not so!!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,The Energizer Bunny of robot vacuums,"We previously owned a Roomba.. but it went haywire (reprogrammed its own language and schedule.. scary AI nightmare stuff!). This roborock vacuum FAR EXCEEDS it. The run time is amazingly long. It cleans in an actual, calculated path instead of a random pattern like Roomba. It‚Äôs rug friendly and adjusts by floor texture. I have 2 pets that shed a crazy amount of fur and this vacuum handles it like a champ! VERY happy with it!!!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,My floors have never been cleaner,"I have a dog that sheds, and live on a like with sand. My floors always have dog hair and sand. My friends liked this model so much they ordered a 2nd one for their lower level, so I thought I would give it a try."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing product,"¬†This thing is the best house appliance I've ever bought. It's extremely hard for us to find time to vacuum our house. This vacuum almost didn't get stuck, and when it did it solved it by itself. It found its way through my apartment even though we have lots of furniture around. I could not believe how clean this made my floor! It's better than the handheld vacuum I have. It even worked on our rug."
3.0 out of 5 stars,Works ok but not great,"having only had iRobot vacuums before, I thought to try this one out based on such good reviews. Frankly, I don't see it. The positives are it's a little quieter than an iRobot, but not really quiet overall. But I have found the electronics to be quite stupider than the iRobot series in general. It also gets stuck much more easily, and does not seem to learn anything at all. Giving this one away because I can't return it and went back to an iRobot, much happier."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great Value, Great Vacuum",Great vacuum. It has everything you'd need for a good medium segment robotic vacuum:
5.0 out of 5 stars,Very good little vacuum,Was skeptical about buying one of these for my mostly hardwood/tiled floors. Surprised it works very well. Only had a few times it stopped when a small piece of tile got sucked up in the brush. Got stuck under a chair once. It really sucks up the hair from a 100 lib husky mix. I am really happy with this robot vacuum and recommend it. On a note of pure honesty my dog disagrees with every thing in this review. He is scared to death of it.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Almost perfect.,This is a great no frills vacuum. We have luxury vinyl plank flooring with area rugs and tile. All were done barefoot clean. It used half a charge to do about 1200 sq ft. Don't be afraid if it seems a little random at first. After it maps the area it gets more efficient each time. This bot does not allow room naming or virtual walls but there are walls available. I returned this model to go up to the S4 for the extra features. But if you can live without them this is a great choice.
5.0 out of 5 stars,It's Like Having a Pet,"I like this product a lot! I love the fact that my carpeting is clean - it actually does quite a good job. It's programmed to do all the areas eventually. I love when you tell it to go back to it's resting place and it does that. It's fun to watch as it rumbles around, bumps into things, but hasn't destroyed anything - yet. :-) Worth the money if you tend to forget to vacuum or you just don't like to do that chore."
2.0 out of 5 stars,Almost works. I can no longer recommend.,"I already own a Roborock product but I decided to add the Roborock E4 because of rave reviews and a great price. It does clean very well and efficiently. It‚Äôs one of the few robot vacs that runs in a straight line pattern and that‚Äôs what got my attention. Especially at this price range. It was easy to set up and it cleans as good as my Roborock E25 on wood floors. The map will feature is only there to show you what it cleansed but is not interactive. For the price, I‚Äôm happy with how it performs."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Constant error 8, avoid","Great suction but has the same error issue as the original mi robot vacuum. It stops cleaning with ‚Äúerror 8‚Äù for no reason every 10 min or so. Nothing is clogged or stuck in the brush. So annoying. Contacted customer service, they told me to return this one and upgrade to the more expensive version."
5.0 out of 5 stars,WOW!,This thing is a game-changer! I have two very hairy large dogs and a longhaired cat. I had no idea how much hair was lying around until I got this. I have run it for the last 4 days and each day it has sucked up a small dog's worth of hair. I feel so accomplished when it completes its run and re-docks. It does such a better job than I could! This saves me at least a couple hours a week. You will not regret this purchase!
1.0 out of 5 stars,Not even a year and it‚Äôs broken!,"So 1st off this vacuum was amazing when it worked! However it‚Äôs been less than a year that I paid over $400 and it‚Äôs already giving up. The last robot vac I had for 3 yrs, bought it used at $150 and it was still going strong when I gave it to my sister and decided to upgrade to one with mapping. Well that one is still going strong and mine has basically quit! The suction power is almost non existent! And it doesn‚Äôt follow pattern like it used to do!"
2.0 out of 5 stars,Painfully dumb,"I have a studio with mid tile carpet. Overall the device seems pretty dumb. I really don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs using the map, it keeps hitting the same place for minutes, after you unstuck it, sometimes it loses its position and cleans previous places it already cleaned. Even if you move it manually into a new area, it follows very inefficient route or even goes back to the closest area it already cleaned."
5.0 out of 5 stars,An excellent value!,The Roborock E4 has been cleaning my floors for 5 weeks every day and I am impressed with it. It runs for almost two hours and only uses about one half of its battery. It picks up dirt and dust and whatever else is on the floor every time. The dust bin is large and easy to clean and the filter has used only one half of it‚Äôs life expectancy. I purchased 8 replacements for less than $20.
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Caution, do not recommend. Problems just mount up.","Liked this for 2 days. It has decent suction and worked great for a couple days. Then the problems started. It disconnects from my home network constantly. I have to setup it up like new every couple of days. This is the only smart device in my house that has this problem. Now it is extremely loud, was quiet when I first got it. I have only had it 30 days, now when it starts up, you can hear it in the whole house. Apparently I am 1 day outside of the return, now will have to work with warranty to get it replaced. Do now buy, stick with the name brands. There are other issues but those are the top two."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very smart, effective robo vac","This is my first robovac and I just got it yesterday, so we'll see if it holds up. So far it's awesome. It was a little difficult to connect to wifi, took a little time to troubleshoot but got it working. Battery seems to really hold up, I started at 58% and it ran for an hour cleaning my wood floors before I docked it at about 35%. Watching the vacuum run I can tell it's a smart one. It worked its way around the house without missing a spot, and without repeating rooms/areas. App allows you to set schedules and program automation, but it doesn't allow you to section off areas of the house to clean as I hoped it would. It maps out the floor after it's done so you can see if it missed anywhere. There is a remote control on the app to run it manually and also a spot cleaning feature that you can set it to do a 5' area. Overall super pleased with my purchase right now, definitely recommend this for it's price range (I got it for $190 on CybMon)"
2.0 out of 5 stars,Misleading information,The product is decent but there is a lot of misleading information.
2.0 out of 5 stars,Not so sure- cleans the same space,"Got this earlier this week. It's pretty nifty and it cleans well. The only thing that I'm noticing I don't like is that it cleans the same place over and over again. I have a relatively small house (1000sq ft) a normal amount of furnishings/floor items and when it cleans, it doesn't clean in the pattern described on the post. It's pretty erratic in where it cleans this leading to missing some places entirely and cleaning the same area multiple times. I'm going to see try it out for a couple more weeks, but may be returning."
3.0 out of 5 stars,Meh it's pretty good.,"The device wouldn't connect to the app at first. It asked me to add device, I do. It asks me to add room, I do. Then goes back to add device, then add room with nothing showing up from the previous time, and the loop continues. I eventually got everything to link after a while and some restarts but I would not rate ease of setup high, I think this is more of an issue with the app not the vacuum though so the manufacturer needs to work on that. The vacuum itself does a pretty good job on hardwood and tile. I don't have carpet and my area rugs are stored currently but it did get stuck on a bathroom rug and had some issues with the hardwood to tile transition strip. It did do a good job getting under the bed though which is one reason I purchased to start with."
1.0 out of 5 stars,Poor product,Would not connect to WiFi
5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this little sucker,We purchased this robot vacuum after reading kits of reviews. So glad we did!!! We live in a 1400 sq/ft apartment with a dog that shed and 2 teen boys... this little robot gets the job done for sure! The ability to program cleaning times is a great feature to have the house clean when you get home from work.
2.0 out of 5 stars,Would Not Recommend,"My neighbor and her sister have this vacuum and love it, but our experience was very poor. First, the vacuum wouldn‚Äôt pair with either of our phones. We did all the things, would not work. Second, it does get itself stuck in ways that a less expensive vacuum never did. Third, I‚Äôve watched it roll over larger bits of crumbs... and leave them behind. It‚Äôs suction, while in theory more powerful, was comparable to a vacuum a third it‚Äôs price. It would move in a grid fashion in the strangest of areas, such as around our ottoman, but never the full room."
5.0 out of 5 stars,It does a cleaning great job,"¬†I bought this item because it‚Äôs hard for me to clean certain places (under the beds and sofas), and I was totally amazed by the great suction job this Roborock E4 Mop Robot Vacuum and Mop Cleaner, Internal Route Plan with 2000Pa Strong Suction does. I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking to buy a great deal at cheaper price."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent at preventing pet hair accumulation!,"I originally purchased this to try out one of the cheaper robot vacuums with the amount of pets we have. We have 5 rescue dogs and 5 cats for reference. Our vacuum goes through the main areas of the house where the animals are twice daily. For the two weeks I have had this vacuum, there has been NO accumulation of pet hair. Prior to this vacuum, we had accumulation within 2 days that needed to be swept up. I got this vacuum to help with the accumulation of pet hair and I say it works BETTER than I would have imagined. It does not map the house, but it has gotten a good idea of the main areas and goes through them all during its cleaning time. It was easy to set up, though it refuses to work with my Alexa. Despite this, the app is easy to use and I have it on a timer. We empty it out every 2-3 days and we have had 0 problems with it so far. I have not tried out the mopping aspect, but I have high hopes for this too. For pet hair, this is a great, cheap option. If it can keep up with 10 animals, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs an excellent purchase!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product for money,"Excellent product to keep house clean with little effort. I have hard floors on my house and worked excellent. Does the whole house doing an N path and aftter cleaning starts on the edges. After that, returns to the base. My house is small 60 square meters and use less than half batteries with medium suction power. Incredible the dirt that this device can grab. Not for deep clean but keeps your house clean. I recommend it a lot"
4.0 out of 5 stars,Competent vac gets the job done while I'm doing other things... Or absolutely nothing!,"As a vacuum to I'm happy with it. While it's not always thorough the first time, it has no issues if I tell it to repeat clean. As a mop, however, I should have read more about it. The instructions say I can only use plain water! How much cleaning can it possibly do with plain water? That's disappointing. I should have just bought a model that did vacuuming rather than pay more to get a model that mops as well."
1.0 out of 5 stars,YOU BUY CHEAP YOU BUY TWICE,¬†Absolute trash
5.0 out of 5 stars,The Lazy Man's Game Changer,"My dog is awesome, but he sheds like a cave yeti. This robot picks up so much dog hair that I've considered starting my own wig/toupee company. ""Dang that hair looks real.. was it created in a lab?"" ""Nah... but it was created by a lab."""
3.0 out of 5 stars,Stopped working,"The suction power is decent it does suck up dog fur very well but it would need to go over the house 2 or 3 times for it to completely clean it. You can control it through their app but other than that there‚Äôs not much to do other than tell it to vacuum and how strong the suction to be. I use the turbo option because I have huskies and their furs are just everywhere, and let me just say that it sounds like a regular vacuum. Not quiet at all on the turbo setting. I received this product on January 17 it is now January 28 and my robot has now completely stopped working. It says it‚Äôs offline but if it was offline why won‚Äôt it let me turn it on? Does the wifi have anything to do with the power system? And I have wifi so it should be working.."
3.0 out of 5 stars,Won't Stay Connected to App,The vacuum operated great when it was connected to the App. It took almost an hour to get it to connect to the app when I first unboxed it. Then it was fine for about a month. Now it will not communicate with the app. I can see the vacuum in the app but can't control it. I get a connection time out type error. I uninstalled/reinstalled the app 3 times and also removed the vacuum and re added it to the app. No success. Tons of reviews about this same problem but I figured I'd try it out anyway. Roborock needs to team up with a new app. Mi Home App is absolute garbage with the Roborock E4 vacuum! Spend the extra $25-$50 bucks and get a different brand.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great help,"I‚Äôm love with this product. I like how in the app I can program the cleaning very easily and see where it went with the map. It is very efficient and I really like the different cleaning options it has. It goes very well on carpets, even if they are a little tall. I‚Äôve been using it forever 3 weeks now, and so far, so good (except for the cat that is terrified by it)."
1.0 out of 5 stars,JUNK,"**UPDATE** vacuum will no longer charge, rendering it useless."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Overall great,"The only negative things I have to say about it is that it's a little on the bigger side and too tall to fit under some things but not a big issues and it seems to have some difficulty getting back to its dock. Eventually it gets there but it takes it a while to find its way back. Overall, we are very happy with it. It seems to have a good battery life and does a really good job cleaning up all of the dog hair in my house which there is a lot of it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,A very good vacuum for the price.,The RoboRoc vacuum does a very good job of cleaning. My only complaint is that it gets hung up on furniture. I haven‚Äôt uses the wet feature yet so I will have to write another review later.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Very impressed,"My most recent robot vac was a low end Eufy. It did a fine job cleaning, but it was a random pattern and would get stuck often under couch. I then saw an ‚Äúepic‚Äù deal on amazon for the roborock. It has been fantastic in its machine learning patterns. I can believe how much dog hair it picks up even though we have central vac. I have yet to see any docking problems. Big thumbs up"
5.0 out of 5 stars,great for hardwood and suitable for high pile carpets with patience,Great battery life. The first time we had it on the carpet it kept going over the same spot infront of the couch. I think bc maybe from the weight the sensor sensed there were obstacles so it felt it was in a boxed area. We kept it anyways bc of most of our house being hardwood (its great for hardwood) our carpet is high pile threads (thick carpet) so this modle wasn't exactly the best choice. But over time it does the entire carpet now with no mess ups. I think it just needed to map it correctly. I wouldn't recommend for high pile carpets but it does ours just fine now
5.0 out of 5 stars,Just the right functionalities I am expecting,"¬†I have tried vacuum with random route, don't really work well, most of time spent in wrong places. This one will scan the room and vacuum in parallel lines. It can also detect stairs so won't go down stairs (see my video)."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"does it come with the water tank, mop and mat or no?","the box appears to be new when arrived however, when i emptied the contents, it appears the adjustable water tank, mop cloth, and the moisture-proof mat is missing. the manual says it includes these items on the parts list, but my box did not include them. very disappointed, we bought the E2, which is this product's little brother and it comes with all that plus an extra filter and brush. Don't understand why roborock does not include these accessories anymore."
1.0 out of 5 stars,Don‚Äôt buy if you want it to work more than once.,This is the second time trying to use this vacuum after purchasing it in July. The vacuum kept saying that it was stuck however there was nothing around it. This happened countless of times. Finally I tried to contact support to just return it after learning that they won‚Äôt take it back after 30 days. So I wasted $270 for a product that does not work. Don‚Äôt want waste your money and find a product that will actually vacuum your floors without being babysat like others have described.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Better than Eufy 11s,"So far it's done a great job vacuuming my hardwood floors and area rugs. It doesn't pick up all the dog hairs from the rug, but it does a better job than anticipated. I had a Eufy 11s previously, this vacuum seems to detect objects better, doesn't run into the wall or tables as much, and vacuums better in general. I added command strips to the front to help the bumper last longer since my Eufy got scratched up very easily and I think that limited the sensor's ability to detect objects."
5.0 out of 5 stars,my first robo vacuum and doesn't disappoint!!!,"love this little robot !! very efficient and great and i got it during a sale too ~~ the only downside is the remote control but i don't use it much anyway üòÇ i love how it goes in zigzag motions and really gets every space ~ my mother loves it because she doesn't need to do the vacuuming anymore. the noise is fine and the suction power is great! i named this little robot ""rocky"" üòÇ awesome purchase. have this for a month already and it's super!"
2.0 out of 5 stars,Gets tangled and stuck on medium pile carpet,I have had this since Mother‚Äôs Day and the side brush is already destroyed! I have a medium pile rug in my living room that it got stuck on and just twisted and twisted onto a piece of carpet. It was so tightly stuck that I actually had to cut my carpet! I was so thrilled to have this until this happened! Then I went online to buy a replacement part and it is $16.00 for jut one. That‚Äôs crazy since I have only had this for 1 week. I would not recommend this for medium pile carpets.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great vacuum,I love this vacuum. It does not replace my regular vacuum because it does not do corners or triangle type corners but it does great on a straight way. It also does under my beds. Its never been so clean under them. I found it works best to confine its space. So I only let it do one room at a time rather than giving it freedom to go whether it wants. I highly recommend it.
2.0 out of 5 stars,Choose any new versions. This one sucks.,"I wanted to love this vacuum and was extremely exited to try. Have Tried. Really Disappointed. It gets stuck on the middle of the room where is nothing around and asks to restart. It cleans room within 45 minutes (I would clean whole house during this time, not just vacuum), it goes to the same spot 3-4 times (what for? Idk) there is 0 logic in its movements. Sending it back. Planning to get s4 or s5"
1.0 out of 5 stars,App is garbage,"I am pretty technical, the app cannot connect to the vacuum. I tried reset wifi and even uninstalling the app and reinstalling multiple times."
4.0 out of 5 stars,No Mopping Kit,"Overall this is a low cost model that works well for the price. I cannot review the mopping function because the water tank is NOT included. Expect to purchase the water tank separately for around $40 and I did have trouble finding it in stock. The app function is very limited, only turns the unit on or off (cannot set cleaning zones etc like some other models)."
4.0 out of 5 stars,Must have.,"I love this thing. Most specifically, for carpeted floors. I don't think it does quite as well on laminate/wood/tile, but it is perfect on carpet. I set a schedule for it to clean my first floor daily. It's absolutely perfect for bedrooms where it can easily clean under the bed and dressers. It leaves nice fresh lines just like a regular vacuum would so the carpet looks freshly cleaned. I recommend it to everyone. Totally worth the price."
4.0 out of 5 stars,Picks up cat hair and vacuums under beds,"We are very happy to have our new helper. It works like a drunken sailor, in a pattern that seems to make no sense, but it eventually gets it all done. You do have to watch to be sure you have blocked off chairs that are too low and picked up shag rugs. It takes a couple of uses to know what needs to be removed. After that, take a nap while your house is vacuumed. Must remove filter to dump what it picks up and clean filter and let dry before use again."
3.0 out of 5 stars,Works well if you're not worried about it just bouncing around,"It does do the zig zag pattern which cleans well, and after a year of ownership I am noticing the flaws of this unit. The control app is okay, but very minimal. Could be better. The vaccum cleans fairly well and picks up alot of stuff, but over the last 6 months or so, I have noticed it gets stuck more and more often, to the point now where it rarely completes a cleaning cycle without getting stuck. It also has a hard time returning to its base and doesn't charge unless it is perfectly aligned on the charger which most of the time the robot cannot do on its own. It cleans well for the price, but ultimately I would recommend a more expensive unit with the laser guidance to get a better experience"
1.0 out of 5 stars,Simply doesn‚Äôt work‚Ä¶.,"This is the dumbest ‚Äúrobot‚Äù I‚Äôve ever seen. I‚Äôve had this thing for months and it does not do it‚Äôs job. I have a 2,000 sq ft house and it struggles immensely. Not once has it been able to clean the whole house AND make it back to the charging base. In fact, it struggles to even leave the room where the charging base is located. It will randomly stop and say there is an error when there is NOTHING in the way. And then you have to go re-start it just for it to have an error again within the same room. Also just does not vacuum very well. Misses a decent amount on my hardwood floors. There is no memory, which is fine, but it doesn‚Äôt even consistently move in the right direction. Lots of sporadic movements for no reason. Would NOT recommend."
2.0 out of 5 stars,Under performing compared to advertise,It's a good buy as I got a good discount..
5.0 out of 5 stars,Oh my!,"I can't believe I'm saying this about a vacuum cleaner, but I absolutely adore this! I live in Georgia, it's the middle of summer, and I have 4 adult rescue cats. They shed. A lot. I've only had it a week, but so far I am extremely pleased. It does the work, and I can sit down with a glass of wine and chill. If it washed dishes too, it would be perfect."
2.0 out of 5 stars,You get what you pay for.,"I bought this robovac because, between my four-year-old, our new puppy, and a front yard packed with pine trees, our living room and front hallway are constantly covered in debris. I was sick of vacuuming and sweeping every day. However, this boy did not do the job. She left pine needles, pet fur, and other debris in the living room, and as far as I can tell, didn't even go into the hallway despite the fact that the door between the two spaces in 5+ft wide and she should have found it easily. She spent 10 minutes under the TV cabinet, TWICE, and got hardly anything else. I ran her twice, once on balanced and again on powerful mode, both times to lackluster results. Sending her back and getting a better model from a different brand."
1.0 out of 5 stars,Waste of money!,"I bought this to replace my older model Shark robot vacuum. The Shark picked up great, but never followed a pattern, and it seemed to be attracted to power cords. I had high hopes for the Roborock because it ""did"" go back and forth in a pattern to make sure everything was covered. After about a month, it began getting jammed in areas it never had before. (Under the front of the recliner, under the sofa, under the coffee table, etc.) It doesn't get stuck e every time, but it's becoming more frequent. I've only had this vacuum 10 months. I had my Shark 5 years. For the past few months I have been sleeping my floor AFTER the roborock runs because it barely picks up anything. It has also started randomly coming off the charger. Half the time it has to be charged up first when I'm ready to use."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Impressed so far.,Bought to replace a irobot and so far this thing blows it out of the water. The suction alone makes this vacuum far superior. Love that it vacuums in a actual pattern not some random BS. You can really see it vacuums everything. Gets stuck far less frequently than the irobot did. If my shark robot gets any worse I'll be replacing it with one of these too!
1.0 out of 5 stars,Ok. No Alexa / Google Home. No new features.,UPDATE 2020.11.21
3.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn't work well on dark surfaces,"We have a 2-story home. On the second floor, we have gray colored floors with black and brown area rugs. We purchased this product, as it has the feature we needed to not fall off the stairs. However, there was no mention, at the time of our purchase, of it not working on dark colored surfaces. So needless to say, we had to swap the one on our first floor with this one. The problem with our first floor vacuum, is the battery life. We have over 2200 sq ft on the 2nd floor. So the battery life is short. This does work great on the 1st floor because we have light color flooring. I have not used the mop feature as of yet. So my only draw back, don't buy if you have dark flooring"
5.0 out of 5 stars,The E4 is a winner,"I tried the E4 instead of the S series after reading that the suction power, battery and main other features were on par. I have not been disappointed! The navigation is smart enough, it‚Äôs definitely powerful enough and the mopping attachment leaves my floors feeling wonderfully clean. Only negative is that I cannot set up Alexa control as this is not on the miHome app. It asks for the Roborock app instead which doesn‚Äôt seem to feature the E4 range. So that‚Äôs an app issue. But bottom line if you‚Äôre looking to save a bit of money and not splurge on the Lidar range, and want a solid vacuum the E4 is a winner! I have never had this much fun cleaning :)"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Gets pet hair and dirt left behind from other vacuum,"The picture is the first scheduled clean ‚ÄúWallie‚Äù did around my house. Mind you I vacuum at least four days a week to keep up with my dog‚Äôs shedding...but look at all the hair and dirt I wasn‚Äôt getting! I have two bedrooms, the living room, and the kitchen the Roborock has to clean and it took an hour and twenty mins. The vacuum still had 50% battery life after running on ‚Äúbalanced‚Äù (there‚Äôs four suction settings to choose from). Once cleaning was done, emptying the canister was a breeze. Just dump, rinse, let dry for 24 hrs (I stuck the canister and filter over my vent to speed up the drying time‚Äîalways make sure everything is COMPLETELY DRY before popping it back into the vacuum), reinsert the canister and you‚Äôre good to go for the next cleaning! The app gives updates on what the vacuum is doing, allows you to set scheduled cleanings, and puts the vacuum into ‚Äúdo not disturb‚Äù mode that‚Äôs customizable to whatever time you choose. HIGHLY RECOMMEND this purchase after one use. I‚Äôll do another review after putting some hours on the vacuum!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great little helper!,This is the first robot vacuum that I have had. Three of my daughters-in-law have them and loved how they worked. We have two dogs that shed badly and a daily vacuum is necessary. This little guy does the job. It runs in a logical pattern and covers all the floor. No need for me to be constantly vacuuming. I can do my other jobs while it runs.
5.0 out of 5 stars,So Far So Great!,"i purchased this Roborock after buying the Eufy S11. I didn't care for the random bumping and pickup of the Eufy so I elevated for the extra $50 for the Roborock. This is an amazing vacuum! With the optic eye that accurately calculates the floors and picks up everything in it's way, it's amazing. We have a cat and the amount of hair and dirt that it's getting under chairs and other furniture, I am truly amazed. I don't need a robot vacuum that maps the rooms, but this one does. It gets all the corners and the edges and slows down when its approaching an obstacle. It also is able to maneuver my carpet (mid-length). Love this vacuum - I will get another for the upper foor!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Works great, but the dock power cable doesn't stay plugged in.","I've had this vacuum for three months now and I love it! We run it at least once a week and it does a great job on our hardwood floors and small rugs. It does get hung up on the lip between rooms sometimes, but we live in an older house so they are a bit taller."
3.0 out of 5 stars,Several issues right off the bat,"Great vaccuum/mop combo. Vacuums and mops at the same time. Unfortunately, is not a very smart robot. Gets stuck frequently in the open air (no obstacles whatsoever), which is a downgrade from my $100 eufy vac only. Mop needs to be in ‚Äòspot cleaning‚Äô mode to be effective. For the kitchen, needs to run three times to produce a totally clean floor. Has a really hard time docking, despite 5‚Äô clearance on either side. Joystick mode/remote control doesn‚Äôt really work. If you‚Äôre patient and get to know it‚Äôs idiosyncrasies, it is a really cheap robot vac/mop combo that does the kitchen floor for you!"
3.0 out of 5 stars,Not impressed,"Does not clean as well as my old Neato. Cleaning pattern is not very organized. Will not circle around table legs and it just bumps into them and bypasses going under the table. The suction is not as good as my old Neato. It goes over my rugs, but then I can shake them out and get lots of dirt I have to sweep up. Would not buy again. You get what you pay for."
2.0 out of 5 stars,Save your money and get a smarter one.,"Not the smartest robot vacuum made, and I wouldn't trust running it while not home, this thing gets itself stuck on everything, and when in a bind it will just go back and forth, but will not turn to get unstuck, my advice is get one that actually learns while it vacuums, this one is like having to keep an eye on a small child running through the house."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Picks up well,"Love this vacuum. It doesn't just roam randomly. It goes in an order. I haven't had a chance to get it connected with my phone but as for it's performance, it is excellent and easy to clean. We have two dogs and a cat and this thing cleans up everything. It will get stuck in our higher pile carpet but only occasionally. Nothing to fret about."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Much better buy than more expensive name brands,"This is our 3rd attempt with a robot vacuum. The previous two were different big name brands and this one beats them by a lot! It moves from carpet to hard floors with ease, moves in a pattern so it catches all the dirt and can do the whole 1200 sq feet of our main level with one charge. I also like the option to add on the mop function later."
4.0 out of 5 stars,Gets every spot.,"I love that it cleans in a ""z"" pattern instead of ping ponging all over the room. This one actually gets every spot. If it runs out of time it will comeba k out and finish once its charged. Were unable to take advantage of the wifi portion since our wifi isn't strong enough but still works okay if I turn it on before bed. The only issue is its having trouble making it back to the charger where I have it. May just have to move it."
3.0 out of 5 stars,Cleans well.  Scratches baseboards though ‚òπÔ∏è,The vacuum cleans well. I would say it‚Äôs biggest down fall is it is scratching the piss out of my base boards. It will drive right up to it hit the bump stop and start spinning. And just starts scratching the baseboards.
2.0 out of 5 stars,"Internet Connectivity Issues, Algorithm Consistently Misses Rooms","Reset Router, Connect, five minutes later, connection lost -- repeat ad nauseum, repeat ..."
1.0 out of 5 stars,Bad product. Broke in less than a year. Bad customer service. Just a bad brand.,Didn‚Äôt last more than a year. Side brush rotor doesn‚Äôt even rotate anymore. This is my 2nd vacuum from this company and both broke so easily. Worst of all customer service is so condescending. Goes all out in every communication to tell you how the product warranty would cover this or that if I did this wrong or did that wrong. Great way to stand by your product.
3.0 out of 5 stars,Will not download CH app but good Robo vac,"You must download MiHome app to your phone, made in Beijing CH. I just taught my Robo vac to clean my downstairs without any app. Will not put CH app on my phone. Excellent Robo vac."
1.0 out of 5 stars,Poor performing and equally supported product,"ZERO STARS IF I COULD SUBMIT IT-Bought this product in August of 2020. It has been an extremely disappointing experience from the beginning. The manual is useless. Product description stated that you could program it which cannot be done. You cannot get adequate support for it when you request it. The only means of support is a email response with vague answers to my questions. IT has stopped working after only 8 months. I don't write many reviews but the miserable experience with this product has prompted me to submit this one. When shopping for robot vacuum cleaners, I strongly recommend that you do consider this product or any other one made by this manufacturer."
3.0 out of 5 stars,Ok,The vacuum itself worked well. The side sweepers didn‚Äôt seem to do much. It kept getting stuck under our furniture. We ended up returning it.
2.0 out of 5 stars,Will not attach to the MiHome app or wifi,"This vacuum works well, but is pretty useless in the overall scheme of todays smart devices. MiHome App will not find the device, won't attach to WiFi...and has no instructions of how to use with Alexa. Have been on the phone with customer service 2x, but very difficult to understand and were no help at all. Only emailed me a copy of the book that came with it. Have been planning to return for refund, but am 2 days past the return window. Guess I am stuck... Any ideas of how to get the MiHome app to find it?"
5.0 out of 5 stars,My first vacuum robot and a really good one so far,"This was my first vacuum robot. I call him Wall-E like the Pixar movie and one of my favorites. This cute little robot has impressed me so far, it‚Äôs cleaned my place very well. My apartment is mostly carpet so if you have a carpet apartment this will do the job pretty well. It‚Äôs missed a small spot or two on each cleaning cycle but you won‚Äôt even notice usually. I love him going up and down in a very orderly fashion all over my apartment and he‚Äôs very stubborn to make sure no corner is left unclean. The integration with the app is flawless and it‚Äôs also shown me a very detailed map of my house. Wall-E finds the charging dock after every session or when low on battery so no issues there. Overall I would recommend this product."
3.0 out of 5 stars,Not bad but you could do better,"I was really excited about using this vacuum and got it for a great deal on here, but it has really underperformed my expectations. We have two kids and two dogs, and therefore quite a bit of dirt and dust from outside, especially on our hardwoods. We've chosen to use it without the Wifi/app, and maybe that would make a difference, but this machine does NOT operate in any consistent pattern -- at least at my house. It does do better on carpet and with ZERO obstacles in the way, but even without obstacles it will stop mid-room and go the other way, missing major portions of the room and therefore leaving dirt, dust, etc. I thought it would circle back to get those places, but it almost never does; it will say ""finished cleaning"" and struggle back to the dock. All that to say, this is not a terrible vacuum, but I wish I would have spent a little more for a better product."
5.0 out of 5 stars,100 percent recommend,We have had her now for months and I love it! I have rearranged the furniture on her twice and she figures it out. My floors are clean all the time. The run time and battery are great the dust bin is a good size. Is she sucks up a charger cord for example she will stop and ask for help sometimes she gets stuck under my kitchen counters but can usually get out by herself. She handles my heavier bathroom rugs well too.
1.0 out of 5 stars,Does not live up to the hype,"Got this product with high hopes and it has been a let down. Does work okay on carpets but not nearly well as expected on hard floors. Gets stuck on every floor rug we have and has to be picked up and moved. Seems to run a lot in the same places and misses others. Don't plan on watching TV while it is running, too noisy. When you tell it to go home it just seems to keep working for another 30 minutes. With as much as I have to fix it while running I cannot trust it to run by itself and quite frankly I could clean my own floors better in less than half the time."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great job on hardwood floor with pet hair!,I did a lot of research before purchasing a robot vacuum and this one checked all the boxes for me. Affordable price for what it does. Efficient smart tracking and not random ping-ponging around. Optional quiet modes. Does great on pet hair ( I have 3 jack russell terriers). I run this little robot daily to pick up all the pet hair. Does a great job for the $200 price point. I don't feel it is lacking in any area really.
5.0 out of 5 stars,We Named Him Victor,¬†Couldn't be happier with this unit. Doesn't miss an inch. Gets into hard to reach areas and can pivot around the tightest corners. (See video) He does it entire first floor in about an hour and then find his way back to the charger. I then receive a map on the app that retraces his movements. Really cool! Highly recommend!
4.0 out of 5 stars,Better than a roomba,"This thing outperforms my in-laws' iRobot Roomba. The Roomba doesn't clean in an ordered way. It just seems to bounce around randomly for a while, then pushes its dock away while trying to return to it. This Roborock cleans in a logical back and forth pattern and has no trouble returning to its dock."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Product Works as Featured,My wife loves our Roborock Vaccum. It has great suction and given time all the floors will be clean. My wife named her new vacuum which wsa a Christmas present - Spide.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Gets it done done,"This is - besides the horrible Alexa integration- an outstanding product. The bot navigates and maps well and can overcome most traps that disable other bots and that‚Äôs a credit to whomever developed the AI. Got it on sale. Price is good even if not on sale for a bot that works this well. Alexa integration is awful, or at least seems to be. Not much luck linking it to Google Home, either. YMMV."
4.0 out of 5 stars,Love this thing!,"Money well spent! We have 4 dogs who all shed. I've set the vacuum up to start every morning and now we have nice clean floors every day. Now if I could just get it to vacuum the furniture! The only negative thing about it is that it sometimes gets confused and seems to forget how the house is laid out which means it vacuums some areas over and over again as well as forgets where the docking station is, but these are minor annoyances that can be overcome with a little human intervention."
2.0 out of 5 stars,No ability to map despite its description,The E4 does NOT work with the Roborock app. It only works with the MI Home app despite what the description says. The MI Home app did not allow for mapping so I could not select rooms or areas to clean. The cleaning it did was fine but I bought it specifically for the non-existant mapping.. The Roborock website has a disclaimer that this unit only works with MI Home but Amazon doesn't have the disclaimer.
5.0 out of 5 stars,It works.,"This is what happened after owning this thing for 24 hours. It sucked up stuff around my house I had no idea I was there. As long as you pick up chords and other items off the floor first, this thing will save you so much work. It does take a while though- over an hour in my house. However, that means it's being thorough!! Cleans my hardwoods and carpets equally well."
2.0 out of 5 stars,Spend money on something better,"Not as good as the other well known brand. Left plenty of loose dirt and stuff around edges here and there, under cabinets, e.t.c. Haven't tried mop yet. App doesn't allow for cleaning specific areas of the map. There is no map. Can't really designate a high traffic cleaning area. I thought this was going to clean better than the pinball machine robot vacuum, but not so."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall, definitely the best robot vacuum I've had.","We really like our Roborock robot vacuum! We have had some of the competitors, and most of them simply don't navigate the space well and end up missing lots of areas. This one has been great and seems to get up a decent amount of dirt. Not standard vacuum level, but pretty good!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,How did I live without this?!,"I sweep, vaccuum, and mop regularly.....so I was absolutely SHOCKED at how much dirt and pet hair this little vaccuum was able to pick up. It maps the house and vaccuums in straight lines instead of bumping around aimlessly like other brands. I live the feature to set automatic cleans and schedulimg. I would HIGHLY recommend against other popluar namebrand robot vacs."
5.0 out of 5 stars,BEST VACUUM EVER,"This is the best robot vacuum I‚Äôve ever seen. It picks up everything‚Äî- cat hair, dirt, dust, litter, etc! We‚Äôre obsessed. I love that it can be controlled by an app!!!! We had a Eufy brand before and it would just blow cat fur around and didn‚Äôt work well on our area rugs at all. This vacuum does it all!!!! I HIGHLY recommend !!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,So far I really like this,"I've had it now for over a month and use it every morning. When I first got it, I was worried about setting it up by what other reviews said. I had no issues at all. Takes about an hour to do the area I want and only uses half the battery life, if that. I have it set on Max too! I do have issues with it getting stuck under a recliner, but I just ordered the magnetic strips which is in a roll (13ft) for only $16. Can't wait for that to come in. Based on my experience with it so far, I would recommend it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Better than Roomba,Not only is this a fifth of the cost of a Roomba it also works faster and has just as much suction. It‚Äôs much quieter than the Roomba. It‚Äôs not as powerful in terms of being able to get up on a high rug for cleaning but that‚Äôs the only thing. Very happy with this product. The floors look polished.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Game changer,"This thing is serious. We have a pretty big area to cover, and though it kind of does the spaces erratically, it managers to get every single room and corner. I LOVE this stupid vacuum. It makes my life so much easier."
4.0 out of 5 stars,Great budget friendly 2 in 1 vacuum,"Very happy with roborock overall. Does a great job of getting our dog hair up but doesn‚Äôt do what I‚Äôd consider deep cleaning especially when it comes to the mop. Happily have it run vacuuming 2x a week with a kid and a 55lbs dog, mopping once a week. I will mop myself every other week for a deeper clean. It would be nice if it could just clean the kitchen and avoid mopping rugs; it doesn‚Äôt map the house but for the price point I‚Äôm satisfied with how much it helps clean"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great, but dumb.","It's really nice for the price, but it is stupid. It's not like the way more expensive ones that create a map of your home and you can set no go zones. It gets stuck quite a bit, but it does well and having it take over the day to day vaccuming has be awesome. If you want a starter smart vac I reccommend. Plus I bought the mood attachment for my hard surfaces. It's just a useful tool for the low price."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Good Robot Vacuum & Great Customer Service,"Works good and picks up just as much stuff as any other robot vacuum. Drives in straight lines rather than randomly which helps it clean faster. Had an issue where trim was being marked by the robot vacuum, but was quickly contacted by Roborock. My issues corrected and any concerns I had will were taken care of. Have since increased my review to five stars because of the customer service."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Exceeded my expectations for my 1st robot vac,"Exceeded my expectations for a robot vac at this price point (black Friday deal for $190). Been using it for about 2 months. After fixing a few areas it got stuck (under low coffee table shelf) it is now very reliable, quiet enough (although you will not want to watch TV with it in the room) and does a good job of daily cleaning of crumbs and cat hair."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought for $199.99,"I've had the Roborock for 2 months now, no issues so far. I have all hard wood floors in my apartment (711 sq ft) & it takes about an hour to clean. Even after an hour it has about 75% battery left so should be able to handle a good sized house. It will get stuck if it sucks up a cord or shoe lace, so be weary."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Robot cleaner,"If you have long hair and are tired of cutting it off other robot vacuums, this is the one to buy."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Powerful & Quiet Vac,"So far, it has proven to be extremely powerful & thorough. It works on a grid & senses objects, gently going around or touching before turning back into the grid. My only problem is connecting it to my WiFi. I will have to get someone who knows more about the technical end to help me there."
4.0 out of 5 stars,Not bad for the money!,"Once you get it paired up, and fully charged, its ready to go.. I would suggest to anyone who is reading this to check the collection bin every 30 mins or so of operation because it fills up quick! The only problem i've had so far (might be something im doing) is in my basement it does all the spaces (including the bathroom) except for a roughly 10x12 area.. Seems to ignore it. Keep up with general maintenance which is conveniently stored in the Mi Home app, and i think for the price point this Roborock E4 is a winner!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,It‚Äôs a NO for me,Absolutely false marketing. It markets as if it has mapping system while it cleans but it doesn‚Äôt. Nor can you feel it to clean a specific room. The only time you can see the map is after. The suction is not all that good and a little bit of elevation in the floor suck as going from carpet to hard floor and it gets stuck
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great vacuum ok mop,The vacuum is amazing. The mop is less so. It does ok in you let it mop every day then you only need a good mopping maybe once a week. But if you miss a day or two it can‚Äôt really clean a dirty floor.
4.0 out of 5 stars,It's good.,"I did end up returning it because the app that it tells you to download is completely unusable and not user-friendly. It was driving me crazy. Took a while for it to learn my house and did have good suction on hard floors and high pile, soft carpet. It's good for its value but beware of the app compatibility."
3.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn‚Äôt clean the messy areas well!,"This is an ok vacuum cleaner. There are many out there that gets the work done in half the price. It‚Äôs little on the noisy side and doesn‚Äôt clean messy areas well like kitchen. If there is stain on the kitchen floor, it won‚Äôt mop it well either. If you are looking for a vacuum and mopper for not so messy areas, it would work."
5.0 out of 5 stars,LOVE THIS VACUUM!,I love this little vacuum! It‚Äôs made my life so much easier!ü§ó Got or for a great price! It vacuums a long time before docking to charge! I‚Äôm always amazed at how much it picks up each time! I run it several times a day because we have small kids and it helps me out so much!
1.0 out of 5 stars,Very sad,"¬†Robot vacuum did not work as advertised. It could not get from my hardwood floor onto the rug. I tried to use Spot clean mode and it wandered around the house. I had to place random furniture around my rug to get it to stay on the rug but it‚Äôs still tried to go out of the area. Very sad I was hopeful, Especially considering the price"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Exceeded my expectations,"I waited 5 months to write this review. This vacuum has been amazing. I've only used my regular vacuum 2-3 times since I received my robot vacuum. And I almost never have to sweep either. This is my first experience with one of these and I expected there to be something less than desirable about it. I thought maybe it would get stuck a lot, or stop working, or not work well at all. But to the contrary, it has exceeded my expectations. It works exactly the way the ad claims. This is honestly one of the best purchases I've ever made. Highly recommend."
3.0 out of 5 stars,Will jack up your baseboards,"The way this thing is programmed to vacuum along walls is dumb and it will leave black marks all over your baseboards and door frames. I had to put felt around mine and now have to go around and scrub all of the marks off of the baseboards. Suction is good, it's but not worth the damage. My old neato did not leave hardly any marks on baseboards."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this vacuum,"This is a great little work horse. I love that I can start it, leave the house and return to a clean house. I have laminate floors through most of the house with tile in one bathroom."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent product, does a fantastic job","Highly recommend this product for hardwood floors, carpet, and vinyl floors. Well worth the money!!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,Does not work with Google Assistant or Alexa,PROS: The standalone app works well and so does the robot suction - it is very strong and powerful. I have low pile and medium pile carpets and hardwood flooring and it works well with all three. It takes about 1min/ sq. metre and I have a timer set up to start cleaning at a fixed time every day. I love that it cleans in a z-pattern rather than a random pattern.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Works Very Well,"This vacuum/robot works very well. It picked up TONS of cat hair. I love how it cleans under beds and cabinets, places a regular vacuum doesn't reach easily. It switches from tile to hardwood to carpet with ease and navigates around the house pretty well. It's quite enough that it doesn't frighten the cats, but they are a bit wary of it."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great at cleaning, but will not connect to Alexa","This roomba is fantastic at cleaning. However, it won‚Äôt connect to Alexa. After reading a bunch of reviews on the actual Alexa app for this ‚Äúskill‚Äù, many users commented the same thing. For me, that‚Äôs pretty much a deal breaker. We are implementing a lot of smart devices in our home to be controlled by Alexa, and since this one won‚Äôt connect, I am returning it. Still giving 4 stars however because I was impressed with its cleaning ability."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Vacuum!,"Love this Vacuum!!!! It gets caught on things which is normal for these types of vacuums, so I always just make sure things are tucked away before I start the cleaning. It is so great to keep up with animals that shed and cat litter!! my house feels so clean now :)"
4.0 out of 5 stars,Decent vacuum!,"Got the vaccum and couldn't believe how much dirt, dust and dog hair it picks up. We programmed it to run twice a day for a while because it is so good at picking up. Imagine having a vacuum running two hours a day in your house. It does get stuck on things quite often but, still worth the investment. I'm already looking into getting a mop so our floor cleaning will be mostly automatic. It is taking about an hour for the vacuum to do a 2800 square foot home with mostly wood floors and area rugs."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great investment--thinking of getting a second one for the upstairs floor in my home!,"Great investment! My first and only robotic vacuum with wet vac attachment. Very pleased with it so convenient and very thorough. It's a little loud but I have bamboo floors and tile which it works great on, also works surprisingly well on my carpet which is a lower pile white shag. Love how it goes back to it's charging chamber. Works well with dog hair which is great since I have three. I use hot water and two caps of Fabulous in the ""mop"" chamber. It also works great on picking up dog hair which is helpful since I have three. Thinking about getting a second one for the upstairs floor of my home!"
3.0 out of 5 stars,He can‚Äôt see,"I like that the robot has good battery life and seems like it could be able to clean my whole apartment, but I don‚Äôt like that it says it is stuck all the time. I check on it and it‚Äôs sitting in the middle of the room. There‚Äôs no objects or furniture near it. It also seems to not work as well when the lights are off which is annoying because I want it to run while I am at work. I have not had a successful run yet. I‚Äôm attempting it for the fourth time and am considering sending it back."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Love love love!!!!,I‚Äôve wanted one of these little gadgets for years but couldn‚Äôt afford the big name brand one. This little guy is awesome! I run it a couple of times a day. Nice to walk into the house and have a freshly vacuumed floor. I figured out that the roller needs cleaned out everyday but it‚Äôs easier. I wish the dust bin emptied out a little differently but all in all I am in love with this product!
5.0 out of 5 stars,Better than expected,"Had the roomba i3 before this one and it is hands down better than the roomba. App is a little funky, can‚Äôt create boundaries unless you put down magnetic strip. We just close the door as a work around. It will detect a step so that‚Äôs good. Overall it was a good purchase and it does have good suction"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Best purchase I have ever made!,"This vacuum is the best purchase I have ever made on Amazon. Truly an amazing machine. I was skeptical at first, that any robotic vacuum could do as good a job as I could by hand, but I was wrong. This little guy doesn't miss a spot. The way it maneuvers around corners and furniture is absolutely incredible."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Takes the work out of vacuuming,"I love this! I have waist length hair and it is no challenge for the Roborock E4. It does get tangled on the brush roller and the sweeper, but it's worth cleaning up to not have hair everywhere. I've vacuumed my entire house three times and it takes less than an hour and a half for a 1450 sq ft house. The first two times it picked up an enormous amount of hair, so hopefully, it will continue to be the beast I believe it is! Very impressed. I wish it had mapping but I'm ok with it not having it for the money I saved! I'd definitely buy it again!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Awesome vacuum, especially for pet hair","We have a large dog that sheds a lot. This vacuum does very well with pet hair pickup. Only recommendation I have is to empty the bin often, even before it tells you to as it will do a better job at cleaning."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Good for daily sweeping,Smart and fast
4.0 out of 5 stars,Too early to tell.,"There seems to be a design flaw. It is always telling me to clean the filter, even 5 minutes after it's been cleaned. However, it works very good."
5.0 out of 5 stars,VERY PLEASED!,"¬†I have been pleasantly suprised at how well this vacuum works. I have never had one and honestly felt more like its a gimmick. However, we do have dogs and this thing has really helped. I run it everyday in the main areas and couple times a week in the bedroom and bath. Even my wife has been impressed. Very satisfied with the results."
5.0 out of 5 stars,We named ours Charlie and it‚Äôs pretty much family!,This little thing has changed everything for us. We have two large dogs that shed ALOT. We looked into vacuums to help keep the house clean and landed on the E4.
4.0 out of 5 stars,Weak suction,"¬†It‚Äôs convenient but I‚Äôve noticed the suction is not that good since I can still see the hair, dusts and other particles on the floor after the robot has swept through it multiple times, so I can‚Äôt really imagine what it‚Äôs left out that isn‚Äôt visible."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great customer service too!,"I‚Äôm very impressed with this little robot. I‚Äôm even more impressed with customer support. I called without knowing it was after hours since I was having trouble connecting it to my wifi. I didn't leave a message, but a representative called me back anyway about a half hour before they were suppose to be open. She walked me though it simple enough. I‚Äôm shocked. She really wanted me to be satisfied with the product. And now I am."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Good vacuumer, really happy I got it","Had been hesitant to buy one of these, is it really worth the money? The answer is clearly yes - the E4 cleans our house daily, navigates around 5 rooms effectively and the kids are now used to picking up their toys every day, as otherwise ""WALL-E"" eats them..."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Smart, intuitive and does it's job really well.","Great vacuum, I'm so happy. It ready does learn the rooms and more well in an organized manner to cover every inch of the floor. It took a little while to get the ap connected to the machine but after a few tries it works perfect. It finds its way back home to charge when it needs to, and then continues where it left off. I got it so I would never have to Mop again, but I still haven't taken time to figure out yet. I'll update the review once I Mop with it. So far it's worth it just sweeping."
4.0 out of 5 stars,It sucks!!,"I bought and returned an iRobot Roomba 675 and this vacuum is 100% better. It does actually ‚Äúthink‚Äù about its pattern and obstacles. The roomba ran into things aggressively and got caught on every single cord. This machine is great, especially for the price. It‚Äôs battery does run down fairly quickly if you have any rugs."
5.0 out of 5 stars,A must have for all pet owners,"I used to vacuum every other day to get my dog hair from getting everywhere. If I did not do this, I used to see bunched up hair all over the floor. One of issues with regular vacuum is hair getting under the furniture such as bed or couch, that are difficult to move to clean underneath. This little robot solved all my hair problems! I run this unit each of my floors every day, and in about an hour, all the visible dog hair are gone! I should have purchased this a long time ago."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great vacuum for the money,"I rarely write a review. That said, I felt I needed to because this vacuum is great. We have a finished basement with Berber carpet. Having two dogs (one is a shepherd) we have some dog hair and kids who can‚Äôt seem to eat chips without leaving tons of crumbs. Before we had an old rumba from Costco and was hesitant on this purchase. This is a serious upgrade. It actually vacuums in straight lines and keeps track of where it‚Äôs been. Not some random wandering. Great vacuum for the money."
4.0 out of 5 stars,The dust bin don't lie.,I really like this product so far. I cannot leave it a 5 star review though as it leaves behind the occasional piece of debris or string that I feel it should have picked up. But the dustbin does not lie it is clearly working.
1.0 out of 5 stars,Don‚Äôt trust the review!,"On day one, so far, I had to rescue it twice! First it stuck on an area rug and rolled the rug up"
5.0 out of 5 stars,I gave it as a gift.,"I gave this to my daughter as a gift. It replaced another brand which stopped working and bounced around randomly. She likes this new one for its ability to deal with lots of dog hair, speed of cleaning and the nice ""mowed lawn"" pattern it leaves behind."
4.0 out of 5 stars,Mama's Helper,"It doesn't have all the bells and whistles some of the more expensive brands have, but ot gets the job done. I'm yet to figure out how to get it to leave my dining room, so I just pick it up and take it from room to room. This might be a pain, but for the price, I knew it wasn't going to be perfection. It's a nice helper."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"It works if you get the crap off the floor. If you have pets, its amazing. clean offten","Large house with capeting. No. Moderate size house with hardwood. Perfect. Buy if you have a pet and area rugs. Finds hair that you would not believe. Keep small crap off the floor, Nylons/tights, panties, and small flexible clothing. It does its best to cover the floor space, Empty often."
4.0 out of 5 stars,Great Robot vacuum but little noisy.,"¬†Roborock runs a great pattern back and forth never missing a line ,it has 3 settings for suction but is a little loud even on medium power when running over rugs it picks up suction power also finishes all edges around each room , we run ours threw Alexa !!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,i like my Roborock,"it does work very well, but we had problems due to the bad internet connection we have here so use the wi-fi and program it so we start it manually, it works well!!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,It only worked correctly the first 3 times I used it!!,"¬†I bought this a couple of months ago. The first 3 times I used it I was happy with the results, it was picking up a lot of dust. From the 4th time, I noticed that I was getting less and less dust in the bin after cleaning. I have used it for a total of 10 h of cleaning now and it doesn't seem to be cleaning anymore the carpet. I can easily see residues on the floor after it finishes (see video). Even in the kitchen where there is no carpet is not very clean. I had to clean again with my old vacuum after its horrible job. Highly disappointed. This is probably the worst purchase I have ever made. I wish I had use it enough from the beginning so I could return it on time."
1.0 out of 5 stars,I do not want to replace this vacuume .,"This vacuum just runs over the same place over and over, in a straight line, I had one before this and it went around the house real good but it stopped working. I just want to return this one and order another one later that will work for me. I am in my 80 could you have someone pick this up for me. Charlene Hatley"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Excelente compra.,"Debo decir que es una compra acertada 100%, muy pocas veces he usado la aplicaci√≥n y realmente no se requiere a no ser que vayas a poner a hacer la limpieza estando fuera de casa. Tenemos un gato y la cantidad de pelo que recoge es impresionante, con una escoba nunca se recog√≠a tanto mugre. Compr√© el tanque de trapeado y es muy √∫til a medida que va limpiando va haciendo el trepaeado. El control remoto no es muy funcional pero considero que no se requiere. Si necesitas limpiar solo una zona, solo basta con cerrar puertas y/o poner alguna barrera como una silla o una caja y listo. Sin complicaciones y muy funcional."
5.0 out of 5 stars,2 hours of non stop vacuuming,Great battery life. I‚Äôm getting two hours of cleaning. Different cleaning speeds. From queit to turbo. Cleans in a ‚Äúz‚Äù pattern it makes sure to catch all the areas. Can control thru app with remote direction. Highly recommended! The app won‚Äôt pair with Alexa. Skill page just sits and won‚Äôt connect.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great unit ! Itself without the mopping feature!,This unit in and of itself is very good and pleased with overall performance. I found the 45.00 mopping attachment to be a waste of money as even in gentle mopping mode dry streaks appeared in track of robot so essentially it does not effectively mop a hardwood or tile floor.
1.0 out of 5 stars,No offense to robots but this one is dumb and blind,Dumbest robot ever. It can‚Äôt even find his docking station when it‚Äôs just a few feet away without obstacles. I have a Roborock S5 Max at home and she‚Äôs a genius. One of the best investments for my home so I decided to get this entry level version for my office. Complete waste of money. I have it scheduled for nightly vacuums for a little over 2 weeks and it‚Äôs completed cleaning just once. Maybe mine is defective but it seems it doesn‚Äôt have any ‚Äúsight‚Äù at all and it doesn‚Äôt have the ‚Äúbrains‚Äù to at least use process of elimination.
2.0 out of 5 stars,"So frustrating. Stupid Vac, not Smart.","This vacuum was unbelievably frustrating. It couldn't figure out that it missed rooms. It wedged itself under the couch, reversed out, went over 2 inches, and wedged itself under it again. It did this for 20 minutes. I was so aggravated that I returned it."
3.0 out of 5 stars,Lower your expectations,"We purchased the vacuum mop hoping to clean up after our two toddlers. The vacuum works just fine, but the mop is disappointing. There is just a moist pad that you attach to the vacuum, no spray or scrubbing. The pad wets the floor but that‚Äôs about it. It doesn‚Äôt scrub up any mess."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Well worth the $$$$,"Purchased this thinking it would fail in a house with 2 dogs, 2 cats, 4 birds. Boy was I wrong! This vac is worth every penny. Picks up not only hair, but feathers, seed and cat litter. Have had for nearly 2 months. Run it 1x daily without any issues. App is easy to setup and use."
5.0 out of 5 stars,BUY THIS!!!,"Wow! Okay. So this vacuum has been a great surprise! I was obviously skeptical about it due to the price difference between this and the Roomba and I need to say, I‚Äôm so glad i gave it a shot!"
2.0 out of 5 stars,Where is the map of your house!?,The vacuum it‚Äôs self it‚Äôs good. The only reason why I gave it a 2 star rating is because it doesn‚Äôt map out your house like people are showing. I can find that option in the app. I find it a little deceiving.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great robo vac,"Great robo vacuum with a good mobile app. Battery lasts long enough to clean entire floor which is about 900 square feet. It's thin enough to go under most of our furniture. It does get ""lost"" occasionally and can't find it's way back to the charger, but not often. Planning to buy a ""smarter"" Roborock for upstairs."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great buy,I think this is fantastic! Really does a great job getting up the debris on the floors and navigating around my furniture. Easy to set up and link to alexa. Cuts the floor cleaning efforts by a ton. I HATE cleaning my floors. The mop attachment is also really useful. Used it 1 time so far after I mopped and the pad got the leftover stuff. I no longer stress about vacuuming after company leaves. Just turn this little bugger on and let it do the cleaning for me!
5.0 out of 5 stars,Dog-friendly,"I am very pleased with this entry level robo vacuum. It is perfect for an everyday sweep of dog hair. Had I to do it again, I would have started with a higher model that allows me to define room areas and starting points. I‚Äôm happy with the low sound too ‚Äî my dogs are fine with it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I love this product.,"Works great app was very easy setting up cleans well. You have to take care of this machine. Clean regularly, empty and change filters every two to three months. They also sell a brush kit at a great value. Order one when buying this great vacuum."
4.0 out of 5 stars,Good suction,I have ceramic tile floors and a couple of throw rugs. It works great as far as cleaning. It does seem to get confused sometimes. It‚Äôs still learning the layout of my house I guess. When I first was setting it up it kept saying not finding my WiFi even though it did. I had to close out the app and reopen it and it was there. Overall it does a good job cleaning. It does get stuck under my dresser sometimes and the little rubber feelers got tangled in one of my shag area rugs so I just vacuum that myself now.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Best purchase I've ever made,"I'm in love! I pored over reviews and product comparisons before settling on this robo-vacuum. I'm so happy with my purchase. We have a very active home between kids and pets and this vacuum has revolutionized my floor care. I went from sweeping 3 times a day to... Never! The suction is great, it's not too loud to run during naptime, and it cleans so much more than I ever anticipated."
5.0 out of 5 stars,So quite on porcelain floor,"Works as intended following a pattern. Nice cleaning in porcelain floor. It cleans my hair and the pets hair. I have a Roomba, and the Roomba is noisy and crazy. In the future I will buy the expensive one, since I know this brand is worthy."
3.0 out of 5 stars,Suction is great but can‚Äôt add app,Love the suction and more organized way it cleans. BUT I have yet been able to add the app.
4.0 out of 5 stars,So far ok,"It has done a decent job keeping the dog hair swept up, and the dust down. It has a difficult time transitioning from wood floor to carpet, and some of the time can not do it. Best for wood floors, would not recommend for primary carpet."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great value,"For the money, this thing is unbeatable. I use it only on hardwood but it zips around extremely quickly and has very strong suction power. It jumps on top of and over mats and even legs of chairs. This thing is unstoppable and very effective. Zero pet hair remains anywhere. Great product."
1.0 out of 5 stars,Broke after a few months,"Was working fine, now won't charge, keeps giving me ""error 13"". Roborock says because I live in Alaska I have to pay to send it to them to repair. Ummm, that is not in the purchase information. And I shouldn't have to have something repaired that I bought only a few months ago anyway! Try another brand."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Surprisingly Satisfied,"Recommend. Looked and reviewed many items, I was skeptical on these vacuums. I didn't want to spend a lot of money and be disappointed. We have dark hardwood floors. Does a great job. Still moving items to avoid it getting stuck. Wish the tray was a little bit bigger in the gathering section, seems to fill up every use. Still trying to find the best place for it's home base. Found myself looking to run this nightly - great coming downstairs and seeing floor clean."
5.0 out of 5 stars,BUY IT! GREAT FOR DOG HAIR!,"If you are debating on purchasing this or not, just do it! This is one of my favorite purchases for our home. We have a German Shepherd dog who sheds like crazy so we are sure to run the vacuum every day but it works so well! Just when I think there‚Äôs no more hair to clean up, it‚Äôs still finds more. We are really impressed with the technology of this robotic vacuum with a low price point. It is much smarter than the cheapest roomba and still cheaper! It is easy to clean and we haven‚Äôt had any issues with clogging, hair wrapping around the wheels or anything like that!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect robot vaccum for those with pets!!!,"I llve everything about this vacuum. It REALLY works. However the remote control feature sucks. It rarely connects or recognizes it. However, I don't really need the remote feature, just a fast cleaning. I'd recommend this to anyone with pets!!! The brush never gets stuck or full like others."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Vacuum,"I really like this little robot. It picks up a lot of stuff off the floor, fits easily under my kitchen cabinets and living room furniture. It is a little noisy but I just have it set to start cleaning at 6 am for a bonus alarm clock for me."
4.0 out of 5 stars,Better than expected,I had a robo vac years ago and was less than impressed so I wasn't getting my hopes up but this vaccine exceeded my expectations.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Works great!,I was having issues getting it connected to wifi but then I just turned it on and it works fantastic on its own. I'm so happy that I finally bought this since I have 3 cats and mostly hardwood floors. I'll try to hook it to wifi again soon but at this point I don't need that feature.
1.0 out of 5 stars,Product failed after just five uses and company refused to pay for shipping for repair.,"After using it just five times it stopped working and gave an Error 13 message which indicated the contacts need to be cleaned. The contacts were spotless, and cleaning them did not help. After several emails with the company they agreed to have it returned for repair, but they refused to pay for shipping since I live in Hawaii. They told me to contact Amazon. Amazon sent me a shipping label and refunded my money. I would not recommend this product or this company."
3.0 out of 5 stars,Set-up screwed up our internet üòí,Not compatible with open wifi. Not compatible with 5g. Lost the bedroom echo dot setting this up.
5.0 out of 5 stars,All in all better than all the Roombas that we have had over the years,"This vacuum is my new sidekick. It is quieter, bigger canister, more thorough (cleans in rows) and can handle rugs or solid floors with two automatic speeds. Better than Roomba and better than that last one that I don‚Äôt even remember the name. It stopped working in a month. We have birds, cats and dogs, excellent job on bird food as well as pet hair."
4.0 out of 5 stars,Sucks good,I returned mine for the next model up that does mapping to turn zones off. This one vacuums great but if you want a mop and have carpet it‚Äôs useless cuz it will spray your carpets with water I returned it for the 5S max which has the ability to turn off certain areas. If you just need a vacuum the S4 works great.
2.0 out of 5 stars,Did not do whole house,"I bought this product to make life easier. It was such a disappointment. It said it was stuck when in the middle of a room, missed three rooms when all doors were open and no threshold to climb. It was supposed to do a room and then go around the perimeter, which it failed to do. I was going to purchase another for the downstairs that I will not do. This was very disappointing as I have a daughter who bought another model and is thrilled with it. Maybe because she is in an apartment versus my house. If I could return it for another model I would do so. Sadly, I bought it and was waiting for new carpet to use it and because of Covid it was delayed and my window to return is closed."
5.0 out of 5 stars,great price super robot vac,"Easy to set up, Mi Home app was no problem, connected first time. This is my second Roborock vac. Purchased for finished basement, works better than I expected, it automatically adjusts from carpet to hardwood, very nice feature. Large dust bin, great battery life, i will be using the mop feature i am sure that will sk work great, perfect coverage, i love that it gets under the beds, great product way better than I expected for the price."
5.0 out of 5 stars,My New Best Friend,"¬†This guy is awesome!!! We have 2 dogs... one being a husky üò£. I run this vacuum daily. It gets under furniture, precisely around it, it learns the floor plan... I love it!!! Perfect for pet hair. I researched many and this one won for price and performance. Highly recommend."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great purchase!,"I had my doubts about how well this vacuum would work at getting pet hair out of the carpet and I was proved wrong. This thing is amazing and I‚Äôm so impressed with how well it cleans and the accuracy of the area it covers. This has definitely been my favorite purchase all year. I definitely recommend buying. I just want to vacuum all the time bc it‚Äôs so awesome, but I don‚Äôt need to bc it cleans so well!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Really good stuff,I bought 1 that was giving me a hard time and acting crazy. Contacted support and was very helpful. Returned it and bought another one. This one is now awesome. Connected to phone with no problems. Thx
1.0 out of 5 stars,Do not waste your time,Terrilble app. Wouldn‚Äôt connect during setup - iOS & android same result. Robot doesn‚Äôt see dock even when it‚Äôs in plain sight. This thing is garbage. Going right back!
4.0 out of 5 stars,Works better with a smart phone or tablet,"I bought this as a gift for a friend of mine. She is 78 years old and not very tech savvy. She has only been using a cell phone for about a year and that is a flip phone. While this unit does clean very well when you simply turn it on, it would be better if you could program it."
4.0 out of 5 stars,Decent Vac for the $$,"The 2 robot vacuums I have clean well-enough in between deeper cleanings with me canister vac. I usually run them at least 2 times a day. Despite having a larger dirt collection container than some competitors, it fills up way to quickly and I keep a clean house. I haven't used the Alexa integration yet"
3.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed,"For the cost of this unit, I was hoping for something better. This unit doesn't tell you when the dust bin is full. It will fill up and leave piles of hair and dirt as it cleans. I have purchased the debot and the hoover, both were less than this unit and both did a better job cleaning."
4.0 out of 5 stars,Could never get it to connect to app,"I tried many times to connect it to the app but nothing worked. I just use by clicking the button on the device and it cleans up great. I wish it would work with the app but that's okay for now, it works great for what its worth."
5.0 out of 5 stars,MUST HAVE!! This is the best robo vacuum I‚Äôve seen!,"This thing is amazing especially for the price point, I have it scheduled to clean while me and my husband are at work everyday and it gets our hardwood floors so clean. It‚Äôs cleaned our sons carpeted bedroom and it does pretty well with that as well. HIGHLY recommend!! It also doesn‚Äôt randomly bounce around your house like cheaper options, it actually makes a z pattern and continues where it left off if it goes to recharge. Our floors have never been this clean! 10/10!!"
2.0 out of 5 stars,It acts very confused,I had an irobot before and once it memorized the path it was very efficient. This one is confused more often than not. Is not thorough. Gets stuck a lot. Remote control is useless. App doesn't do much. Not impressed.
5.0 out of 5 stars,A good friend,"Almost a year with this helper! Works great for everyday cleaning, not for deep cleaning."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"Good vacuum and mop, but ledge detection is not great.","Vacuum and mop work well, but ledge detection is not great. It will fall into my shower if I don‚Äôt shut the door (6‚Äù drop). Also, it will go up-and-over the 1‚Äù wall on the sliding glass door frame and then get stuck."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great basic automated vacuum,"Great basic automated vacuum, impressive suction power (actually sucked up a double A battery, don't think my Dyson could do that!). Very customizable for various power levels, cleaning frequencies and times. Easy to monitor and automate via app. Impressed with it so far."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Buy it now!! It‚Äôs the best,We have two big dogs who shed constantly and this thing is a dream! If we didn‚Äôt have this we would be vacuuming constantly but now the floors are always clean. It picks up so much that we have to empty it every other use but I‚Äôd gladly take that over daily vacuuming. It fits well under most things and it‚Äôs only gotten stuck once (under the dining table and chairs). I‚Äôve raved to everyone I know about how amazing this thing is. Highly recommend it!
5.0 out of 5 stars,IT IS WORTH EVERYTHING,"I would run it, clean the tank, run it again, and it would still find more dirt and hair‚Äîmeaning it‚Äôs obviously not super strong suction. However, who cares? I just run it every day anyway so it doesn‚Äôt need to be perfect."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Love!,Super easy to use. Cleans well and learns floor layout well. We have three cats and run it daily (just need to empty the filter each night). Bought one as a gift for a family member as well!
1.0 out of 5 stars,Total waste of money,"Total waste of money, absolutely useless device, runs around in the same space,"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Well worth the investment!,Was unsure as I was not familiar with the company....very impressed with the ease of use and quality of this product! Very happy to have this robot vacuum! Love it!
1.0 out of 5 stars,Junk!!,"Do not buy this product! after two months, last week started dropping Wi-Fi connection. Now it will not even reconnect, tried two different routers and even took it to a buddies house and tried to reconfigure it there. Two weeks outside my return window. What a big pile of crap this is!! I will be contacting seller to resolve it, supposed to have a 12 month limited warranty."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent purchase.,This is an amazing vaccum. I was lucky enough to have Adam V. of the Roborock support team help me sync it with my phone. I can actually start the cleaning from anywhere! I am so impressed that I recently purchased another for upstairs. Great purchase.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for dog hair,"Don't care for the mop portion of it, but the vacuum has made my life easier. Having a Shiba Inu and her shedding made this vacuum worth the buy"
4.0 out of 5 stars,Cleans well but hard to pair with Alexa,Cleans great. Very difficult to set up with Alexa but it can be done. Seems to work well once set up. Had to call the customer service number to get help. The instructions are very confusing!!!
5.0 out of 5 stars,We named it Felix,"I didn't sync the robot with the app, but it works great starting it up manually. I am very pleased with the performance of this machine. We named it Felix Unger, another great cleaner!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great,"This is a really great vacuum. I love how it goes back and forth in a line instead of bouncing around. My only complaint is that it doesn‚Äôt have the spinning brush on both sides. It causes it to miss some stuff on the edges but this has been such a time saver with 2 young kids who love to get crumbs everywhere and a cat. It does a really good job with hair, cat food, litter, food crumbs, etc."
4.0 out of 5 stars,Let it run a few times before judging its capability.,"First few runs were troublesome, finished too early and it missed a lot of area, had to restart it to get the coverage. Around the third try/day of cleaning it covered just about every square inch of accessible floor without issue. The issue could of been running it on balanced mode because it always gave up on the carpet areas, since running on turbo or max its been on point. I am impressed, and if it holds up over time I see no reason to spend more $ on a more advanced laser mapping bot."
5.0 out of 5 stars,It's excellent,Look for a budget & get the job done this is it . It maps out your house by itself once it does that you program it on what days you want it to clean & it will do it for you . It also works great from floor to carpet . My wife loves it & I do too
4.0 out of 5 stars,Would not recommend unless you want to do the entire area,Good suction power. Cannot find docking station. Goes over and over same areas and gets lost at times. Cannot choose to clean certain rooms instead of doing the entire first floor. If you move it is gets totally confused.
3.0 out of 5 stars,Docking issue,"Love the vacuum, it did good job, but I had returned it due to not going back to dock after cleaning."
1.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth it.,"Goes in straight lines, thats the only good thing. It rubs against the baseboards so hard it screws up the paint. It gets stuck in rooms for no reason, and takes forever to find the dock if it actually finds it. Just stops vacuuming when it gets near the bounty strips, thats right,, it doesn't turn and go somewhere else, it stops sends you a message about a magnetic field and tells you to move the vacuum.. Wouldn't have bought it if I knew this. Junk."
5.0 out of 5 stars,200 is worth it,I have a 2 bedroom hard wood floor apartment all on one level. I have 2 cats. This thing is a tank I love it. Runs 50-60 square meters in 60-80 mins usually. Empty dustbin every use. If you can grab it for 200 like I did it is worth every penny
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great especially at price,Run this thing every morning. Have several dogs. Keeps things from getting out of hand. Really was impressed with it.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great little vacuum for surface cleaning.,"This little vacuum is great. Cleans edge to edge of every room. I lift and secure all cords and it cleans seamlessly, even under furniture. Picks up dirt and small debris.Cleans 1000 sq ft in about 90 minutes. Easy to set up the app and connect."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Don‚Äôt buy if it‚Äôs made in China, unless you live in China.","Make sure you DON‚ÄôT get one made in China or you won‚Äôt be able to use the app, since it‚Äôs only supported in Mainland China. I can start it manually but I can‚Äôt schedule it to start, check the battery, map out rooms, or anything that I was expecting to be able to do as described when I purchased it. It is louder than I expected, unless you run it while you‚Äôre watching TV, but not annoyingly loud. The suction is good, it picks up most of the crumbs and dog hair from the hardwood floors and area rug. Overall it‚Äôs a pretty good robot vacuum, just super disappointed about not being able to use it the way I bought it to use."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Zero Suction, Will Leave Your Floors Dirty.","Very unhappy, both the vacuum and the mop on this Roborock E4 are terrible. The vacuum won't pick up even the slightest crumb and the mop just soaks the floor. Do yourself a big favor and don't waste your money on this vacuum. Spend a little more and get a better brand."
2.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn't work with 5gHz router,"I ordered two of these, the first one didn't do the whole floor and returned to dock."
5.0 out of 5 stars,EXCELENTE PRODUCTO,"SINCERAMENTE LEYENDO LOS COMENTARIOS NEGATIVOS, ESTABA ASUSTADA DE QUE FUERA A SALIR MAL LA COMPRA. SOY DE COSTA RICA, MI ENCARGO LLEG√ì BIEN Y EST√Å FUNCIONANDO EXCELENTE, ES UN GRAN AYUDANTE. LO RECOMIENDO."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Vacuum Excellent; Mopping?  Better than nothing.,"I used to have a 600-series roomba. This thing blows it away. It's suction is much better, and it makes rows so the carpet looks very nice when done. It also has the mop attachment, which does not replace a real mop but it'sy better than nothing."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Love!,It does such a great job getting every inch of every room. I‚Äôm so impressed. I‚Äôve had another brand and it seemed to go over the same spots over and over and took forever. This robot goes in lines and gets under furniture and around anything blocking its way. Love!
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great robovac!,"This is a great little machine, had others but the thinness of this robovac is great, easily moves under furniture, love this little machine!!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Highly impressed so far,"I was very skeptical about robot vacuums being able to really clean. It‚Äôs only been a few days, but I am highly impressed so far."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Best thing since sliced bread,"I had owned another brand and liked it, but I have a new dog and it couldn't pick up all of the hair. I have used this thing twice and my floors look great. It is very structured in how it works through the room. There is no random bumping around. It goes back and forth until it has reached the end, then it goes around the edges. It does this through multiple rooms. I am really happy that once it is done, my floors look clean."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great picker upper! Works on wood floor, carpet, area rugs!",I love this vacuum! It has no issue with area rugs. You can hear the suction increase when it hits a rug. It can vacuum my 1st level which is 1300 Sq feet on one charge and is a mix of wood floor and carpet. Love how it can clean under my furniture; places I have a hard time getting to with a vacuum!
4.0 out of 5 stars,A good product,"This roborock is so far a good product, cleans very well (except in corners), easy to clean and thorough. Does not intimidate my malti-poo, quiet and efficient, a bit on high-end priced. Would recommend."
4.0 out of 5 stars,Good for the price and features,Roborock E4 is a good vaccum cleaner. This vaccum has great suction power and larger bin as compared to others in similar price range. I wish the app was more intuitive with no-go zone and room dividers (which is the only reason for less rating). I know the high end have better mapping technology but I am happy with this one for my needs.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent first robot,My first robot vacuum. I have two cats and a short haired dog. All hardwood floors. This works well as long as I run it every 2nd or 3rd day. It cleans in a good pattern and returns to the dock. I‚Äôm very impressed. This model doesn‚Äôt allow no go lines but magnetic tape solved my problem easily.
2.0 out of 5 stars,This Robot does not seems to pick much up. Even with the power vacuum.,"My Roomba runs rings around this Roborock system. The Roborock is stuck all the time, barley picks anything up."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Super Neat Gadget,"This a very cool machine. This is my first robot vacuum and it‚Äôs awesome to see this gadget in action. You turn it on, sit back and watch your favorite TV show and 30 min later (or less) your living room is vacuumed spotless. Innovation at its finest. I would just suggest moving chairs, furniture or cords out of the way. It is quiet, nimble and has a long battery life. Highly recommend"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Really, really bad","This thing is really, really bad. I almost never write reviews but I‚Äôve had it 6 months and came back just to write so others won‚Äôt get it. It hardly picks up anything and if it actually does, you have to immediately clean the roller and the sensors. It‚Äôs also extremely noisy and I think it‚Äôs found it‚Äôs way home without ‚Äúerroring‚Äù out once. I have since bought a Dyson Animal Ball (which is amazing) to make up where this one lacks. I‚Äôm prob going to just trash it. Save your money!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,Cheap Product and less amount refunded-Pls be aware,The quality of the product is very cheap and the sensors dont work properly...it often struck in different places and even cant come out from some corners if struck....I returned it in two days and later realized that the seller refunded $40 less than I paid. Amazon customer care team helped me to get full refund. I strongly recommend to stay away from this product and seller.
4.0 out of 5 stars,Good!,"It definitely works no issues with performance it does its job fine,just be aware it does get stuck under cupboards or couch etc,it really rams itself in there and can't get out..So if u plan on using this when away from the home id keep this in mind."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Time saver!,"The vacuum is perfect! Just what I needed. It thinks for itself! I hovered like a hen to her chickens. I was amazed at how it worked! Now let it do its work! Smooth floors, short pile carpet, around chairs and tables. Where I ere these vacuums ten years ago! As a retired person this saves time and effort! Thank you!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,Only lasted 2 months,"It worked okay for a couple months. It really does a decent job vacuuming. I purchased mine on March 5th and as of May 25th it no longer charges. I reached out to Roborock support, but have not gotten any response or help."
1.0 out of 5 stars,Don‚Äôt waste your money,0 stars worked great for a few months the. App stopped working and the robot stopped working shortly after
5.0 out of 5 stars,It‚Äôs great!,The suction is pretty great. We run it every night. It‚Äôs not super noise . The mopping is very light but if you do it every day you be pleased.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Why did I wait so long?,"I never seriously considered getting one of these and then this popped up as deal of the day. One of the best purchases ever! ""Margaret"" cleans my whole house, if she gets tired, she will go take a nap/recharge and get back to work. She does an awesome job cleaning up after 2 cats and 2 dogs. We've had her for 5 months and still extremely happy. My mom tried a couple of the other brands and wasn't impressed with them, but Margaret roboRocks!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Hesitated too long to buy one, should have done so sooner!","This thing really sucks!! Wife is happy, floors are cleaner with less work. He‚Äôs kinda like a pet for the kids. They‚Äôve even named him."
1.0 out of 5 stars,I wish I could return this! I wish Amazon was more like Costco in that sense,"Pathetic overall compared to S6 that I got last year. Loses its way, gets stuck everywhere, no map changes or anything to help it learn what not to do. Half of the times the vaccum is found stuck somewhere even as small as 1 inch hurdle around the carpet. Complete waste of money. I wish I could return this."
3.0 out of 5 stars,Not great on thick carpet,The battery life is great. There is no way to map where it goes (from the product review I was led to believe there was). It runs for 10 minutes and says ‚Äúplease remove obstacles‚Äù. The thing is there is never anything within 5 feet of it. I get the sense it‚Äôs not made to vacuum carpet
5.0 out of 5 stars,Roborock e4- good purchase,"This is my first robotic vacuum and I‚Äôm happy with the purchase. I have a large dog who sheds a lot and this vacuum handles fur, dust, and dirt well. I have to dump the canister about once per cleaning of my approximately 700 sq ft apartment. It also seems to be pretty study. My 70lb dog stood on it a couple times after I first got it and it still works! I like the way it follows a linear pattern to cleaning and doesn‚Äôt ping pong around. It is significantly quieter than a normal vacuum. Don‚Äôt have any complaints."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Best robot ever,This thing is amazing it works so well and it really pics up everything and doesn‚Äôt miss a spot the only down side is that it climes over my dinning room chairs metal bottoms and gets stuck I have no way to make it stop climbing over them and getting stuck
4.0 out of 5 stars,Good value for its features.,The mopping attachment and pads need to be purchased separately. It was not clear to connect to the internet but I did get it to operate - must follow the instructions precisely. It does not map or remember each room or your entire floor plan so the room function is only useful if you close off each room. It is much quieter than I expected and handles most conditions and materials well. Customer service is responsive via email but not through the app function.
5.0 out of 5 stars,great for dog hair,We have a heavy shedder and having this run every night really cleans up the dog hair. Worth the hassle freeing from cords and string it gets tangled in
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been using it for a month, and so far I am very happy with it!",I have low pile carpet and linoleum floor. It does pick up all debris on the carpet.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Effortless Cleaning,"I was pleasantly surprised how much dog hair this vacuum could efficiently pick up, and how easily it maneuvered around the furniture. It was easy to start and download the app."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Does the trick,"it is a great help around the house my wife loves it, believe me it works had it for a couple of months already and have not been able to pair it or down load the app to operate it"
3.0 out of 5 stars,Too many hairs tangled at corners of brush,"This is my first robot vacuum, I see the dirt clearly but somehow it misses. The main issue I saw is with tangled hair in the brush. If this hair is in between brush it is easy to clean (comparatively), but all hair is tangled at both corners of the brush. There is much gap between joins at the brush end to joint to the device, that is where the whole hair tangled. It was really pain to clean that hair. Not really sure if that is how all robot vacuums are."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for the price,It is so good and deserves to be in every house that cannot afford high end product of the same.
2.0 out of 5 stars,Very loud vacuum.,"Very loud vacuum. Its super annoying to hear it run while in the room with it. I also have the Eufy G30 and was thinking of getting this for my mom, but couldn't because of how load it is. Other than the noise, everything seems good about it."
3.0 out of 5 stars,You pay for what you get,You get what you pay for. It‚Äôs nice that it cleans in lines but it leaves sections of rooms untouched before moving to another area. It‚Äôll be an hour before it decides it‚Äôs done cleaning but it never touched the center section of the living room and completely missed the kitchen which are the highest trafficked areas. I pick it up and move it to where I need it to clean and it ends up going back down the hall. Super frustrating. But when it does go over the areas it cleans pretty well. So average but happy with the price ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
4.0 out of 5 stars,Schwifty is his name,We love our little robot. Of course we named him. Schwifty. (Rick and Morty fans will appreciate) he does a great job of picking up debris. He even leaves pretty vaccum lines in the carpet. The only thing we find a bit amusing is that he cleans on an angle. He is consist with his angle. He is also very good at getting into and out of tricky places. We would recommend for sure.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Love love love,"This little vacuum has been amazing! Sometimes it has trouble getting back to the dock but overall was worth the money. We have 4 dogs, 6 potbelly pigs, 5 cats and 4 kids and this thing keeps the floor so much cleaner"
4.0 out of 5 stars,Huge help,"I have 2 toddlers and a dog and this vacuum has been my life saver. I put her 2 times per day, sometimes 3. It helps a lot with the left over food and most important with all my dog hair! I‚Äôm very pleased. Moping sucks I don‚Äôt really use it. But the vacuum is great!"
2.0 out of 5 stars,Was okay at first but not worth it,"This vacuum was great for a while. I have now had it for a few months and feel like I wasted my money. It dies quickly, without even finishing the main living area. It constantly gets hung every 5 minutes or so, even when it is in the middle of the floor with nothing around it. There is no point in me using a robot vacuum if I have to move it every few minutes."
2.0 out of 5 stars,If only I can connect this vacuum to the App,"I have done everything in the world to try to connect to Wifi - still wouldn't connect. I am using all compatible equipment, and spent about 3 hours trying to make the vacuum work. I moved the vacuum next to my fast router, and still vacuum would not connect to wife. Frustrating, I'm about to return."
4.0 out of 5 stars,Paid full price for a used product... :(,"I recently purchased this Roborock E4. After using it for the first time (for 20 min), It looks like its been used before and returned (shown in app screen shot). Aside from that, it works fine. The suction is strong, maneuvers around kitchen/chair legs very well and it goes over rugs and somehow managed to deal with the tassels on it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for me,Definitely happy with this purchase. I have a one story house and its perfect. Only thing I don't like is in the app you can only do things in metric measurements instead of customary. Other than that the vacuum is great
3.0 out of 5 stars,Does not deep clean carpets,"It only surface cleans carpets, which means we have to follow up with our Shark vacuum to make sure the carpets are clean enough for our Grandchildren to play and crawl on."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"""Mitchell"" did amazing!","So I was skeptical at first.. but Holy moly! This little guy, which we have named Mitchell, rocked it out on his first run! We just moved in.. and still getting things cleaned up..we have two cats that shed a lot, and as you can see from the pic, it did wonderfully! And I just vacuumed a few days ago too! The only thing I would not rate highly was the inability to connect to the wifi and phone app.. but I'm ok not having extra apps keep tabs on me lol. You definitely won't be disappointed!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,Great product missing a little customized functionality,"Honestly, I returned the item but not for its lack of ability to clean..... this thing functions great and is probably way smarter than your average would be buyer thinks. The only reason I returned is the lack of ability to set digital barriers or no go zones and the mopping is virtually useless. If you have a just reasonably uncluttered household I think you‚Äôll be very pleased with this little guy."
4.0 out of 5 stars,Espectactacular! Una muy buena opci√≥n.,"Compramos primero 1 aspiradora para ensayarla en el apartamento que tiene alfombra de pelo medio. No le compramos el mop option. Es espectacular saca todo, incluso el polvillo que no se ve. Es Tan buena que decidimos comprar otra para regalarle a mi madre que tiene mascotas. El √∫nico pero es que se enreda un poco en la alfombra, pero es relativamente f√°cil de sacar., tambi√©n se pierde para devolverse sola a su puesto. La bater√≠a dura un promedio de dos horas aspirando zonas de piso y alfombras. Nos a encantado."
3.0 out of 5 stars,It works great if you can connect to the app,"Downloaded the app and tried to connect to the E4 and it won't connect no matter what i do. Tried the instructions, resetting the E4, resetting my phone and re installed the app and all possible ways but really won't connect. I'm sure my phone and the E4 is on the same Wifi network and using 2.4GHz band. Too bad that i have to return it back."
4.0 out of 5 stars,I initially received a used one so Roborock gave me a discount on a replacement,"Update on the below. Roborock Customer Service contacted me to apologize and let me know that Amazon controls both new and used inventory. Regardless, Roborock offered me a discount, if I ordered another. I did order another and it arrived in perfect condition."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"A great, no-frills robovac","For a little over $200, this robovac does everything we need it to do and nothing we don't. It may not be the fastest cleaning robot because it doesn't have LIDAR navigation or room-mapaSZ"
5.0 out of 5 stars,I live it,"I love it. I had one before. When that one went out of order, I decided to order the same brand. The price and the quality are excellent. It‚Äôs my little helper around the house"
1.0 out of 5 stars,Works for a bit and then will not connect to wifi - picked up cat hair great when it worked,"Initially I loved this product. However, after 5 months it would no longer connect to our wifi. Called customer service and did not get any where with them. Had to manually start it and I preferred to have it on the schedule, which no longer worked once the wifi connection quit working. Now the wheel has broken and I can't locate how to replace that part. Spend the extra and get a better quality one."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Es una gran experiencia tener √©ste robot aspiradora,Sufro de la espalda y para mi ha sido una maravilla. Es la segunda que compro y la atenci√≥n al cliente es excelente. Se me rompi√≥ una ruedita y me la mandaron de inmediato. Controlas por la App el la succi√≥n y tiene mopa. En la casa la amamo. Varias amigas la han comprado despu√©s de recomendarla
2.0 out of 5 stars,CANNOT OPEN DUSTBIN,"The vacuum works better than expected. However this model does NOT come with the dustbin advertised, so the first time you go to empty the vacuum you will end up breaking the Dustbin following all of Roborocks tutorials for this model. I would not have purchased this model had I known it makes the cleaning very messy."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great fir tile floors,Got a good deal on Black Friday but would have paid more for it if necessary. Works really good on my tile floors. Has gotten stuck under kitchen cabinet bottom edge. I pick up chairs and rugs for it do do a through job.
5.0 out of 5 stars,He‚Äôs good help!,I love my Roborock vacuum! I named it Harry. It‚Äôs unbelievable how much dog hair and dirt he picks up. My only complaint is sometimes he spends too much time in 1 area and runs out of battery before he finishes.
5.0 out of 5 stars,It‚Äôs ok,"It‚Äôs ok, not as good as a regular vacuum, it suctions surface dirt. My dirt container doesn‚Äôt open, I have to take the filter out to empty, kinda nasty having to touch the dirt. Not sure if that‚Äôs a design flaw or if I got one that doesn‚Äôt work properly."
1.0 out of 5 stars,Don‚Äôt buy it! No app to support it!,This product is useless and cannot be paired to the app because the app only supports more expensive ‚ÄúS‚Äù series. It will not pair. What a rip off. I‚Äôm returning it.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Love love love,"Absolutely cannot say enough good things about this. It tells you if it‚Äôs charging, connects to your phone... cleaned our house for 2.5 hours before the battery needed to be charged and I didn‚Äôt have to stop one time to fix it"
5.0 out of 5 stars,I am so happy whit this robot after trying so many and send them but this one is a kepper,I have tri so many robot that mop and bacum that house nothing has work they live to much water and that floors and make thing worse but I am so happy excited whit this robot is fant√°stico you can manege that water that goes on that flor realy bacum y mop that house. I depend recoment this robot ifyou are a fan√°ticos whit clean like me you are going to love this robot
5.0 out of 5 stars,It's a good buy for the price.,For the price I paid it as a really good job. It's not particularly quiet but it usually vacuums the whole house twice for returns to charge. It's short enough to get under most everything and sometimes it'll close the door on itself but it's easy to find and so far it doesn't require a lot of maintenance.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great Product, Great Price",Work‚Äôs great. Easy to start out of the box. Couldn‚Äôt be happier with how it gets around the entire house and picks up tons of dog hair. Rarely break out the regular vacuum anymore.
5.0 out of 5 stars,So far so good,Had it for a month and I use it daily
3.0 out of 5 stars,Meh.,It works. Needs to be on high power to get the job done on vinyl flooring. Misses obvious debris.
1.0 out of 5 stars,Very disappointed!!! Returned,The vac would not pic up small pieces of toilet paper i put out to test. Even after it went over it several times it missed it. It missed whole rooms and said cleaning was completed. It could not find the charging dock. I read good reviews but was very disappointed. I'm not convinced these robovacs are any good. I returned to amazon. Also i started sneezing alot when it was running like it wasn't filtering the exhaust air.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Get it,Honest I feel bad. Why did I not get one of these years ago! This is awesome and is getting in all the tough spots to help make the house cleaner. We no longer wake up with stuffy noses and the air smells so fresh. Working well on hardwood and tile as well as some rugs!
3.0 out of 5 stars,Decent vacuum . Does not work with Alexa,I bought this on prime day and got a decent deal on this unit. Outside of cleaning and mopping one of the main features we were looking for was the integration with Alexa. So far I have not been able to get it to work and I‚Äôve seen others have struggled with it as well. Does a decent job vacuuming
1.0 out of 5 stars,Horrible App Interface,"App is very difficult to get connected to unit (IOS), then once setup/registered will not connect to vacuum to allow for scheduling. Works just fine for those that don't want any remote control interface."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Buy!!,For the price tag and the fact that it actually maps out a pattern vs bouncing around everywhere makes this a great buy. Highly recommend this one if you dont want to spend $$$$ as much for more expensive units.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing vaccum.,This vaccum is amazing. Very happy with the power and time on the battery. Shows me the map on my phone of what has been cleaned. So happy.
5.0 out of 5 stars,It's perfect!!!,"I have too much carpet space in the house and this E4 is perfect. Although I don't have pets, it picked up all my crazy long hairs pretty well lol. Love the automation feature as well. I turned it on an hour before I get home every other night."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Super impressed!,"So thankful I bought this thing! I've always wanted one but couldn't bring myself to spend the money, then I saw this one under $200 as deal of the day. Now that I have one I wish I would've bought a long time ago. If you have a shedding dog you need one! This thing is so amazing. And yes, can it can go between carpet and hardwood with no issues. I had no problem connecting to wifi like some other reviewers said."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great vacuum,"I absolutely love my vacuum so much that I bought my so one, he‚Äôs loves his as much as I do! They actually get into the small spaces that I didn‚Äôt think it could"
2.0 out of 5 stars,Started out well...,"I love the cleaning power of the machine, however, I've only had it since November. It has done a good job up until the past 2 weeks. Now everytime it runs I get Error 5 please clean main brush. My brush is clean and so is the surrounding area. It barely makes it 5 feet before it stops and gives the alert. When it works its fabulous but I haven't even had it 6 months and I'm having issues."
2.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn't clean well,"Doesn't clean nearly as well as a normal vacuum cleaner, maybe 15-20%. It leaves lines in the floor and gets basic things off the floor so it almost looks vacuumed but if you follow with a regular vacuum cleaner, you see how much is really done. It's only really for visual effects in a room"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great cleaning device,"Love the suction power as well as the mobile use. Having a tough time directing the unit where to travel after cleaning the main area and our master bedroom, needs to travel down a hallway to clean a bedroom and bathroom."
2.0 out of 5 stars,Not a fan,"The app is rather frustrating to use - not intuitive or user friendly. Also, pretty frustrating that the robot would continually get stuck under our coffee table rather than mapping it out and just avoiding the underneath part. Alexa integration was basically pointless - it would start the route completely over rather than spot clean."
1.0 out of 5 stars,NOT a Roomba; not worth the money.,"I hated this item. The reviews said it was better than Roomba. No it wasn‚Äôt. All it did was run back and forth in the same area til I manually moved it. This was just a water spreader, but did not clean."
1.0 out of 5 stars,Broke after a few months,"The auction power is decent and i appreciate being able to start it with the Alexa but that all it can do. The remote is tricky to use, but my biggest complaint is the repeated error message after a few months of use and following suggested care guidelines. Wish i could return it"
4.0 out of 5 stars,Works OK,"The robot's pathways are not consistent. Could not get the 'App' to work, not sure what I would gain by working to get the app to work. Works good on hardwood flooring, fair on carpet."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Does a great job!,"I. Freaking. Love. This thing! Named it Kevin. I haven't even bothered to use the app. I turn it on and let it go. I vacuumed really well before the first time I used it and couldn't believe all that it picked up anyway. I have two cats and a dog so pet hair was driving me nuts. Now Kevin vacuums for me every day and my floors are always clean! Has a nice big collection bin that is easy to clean out. Makes me feel kind of like George Jetson, I got a cleaning robot! One of my best purchases ever."
2.0 out of 5 stars,Stuck right on the charger and not charging.,"When it's working it's good, but after one month it start getting issue. It returns home but charging not started. So until you find out and manually put it back, it just stays there. happened three times already. To bad it's out of the return window."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Best robovac ever. Lovely app. Buy it,¬†Love it. Our cats not so much ;p. Highly recommend. Easy to empty out dust bin. App is easy to use and very helpful.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it,"We have two golden retrievers and three cats do we were looking for something to help with the mess. We started with a Eufy ... what a piece of junk! After we sent the vac back for four replacements in less than a year, I threw up my hands and moved on. This little guy has been amazing; so much so that I bought another. Highly recommend."
5.0 out of 5 stars,It works!,This represents my first purchase of a robot. I was skeptical about how well it would transition from saltillo tile to thick carpet; no issues.
4.0 out of 5 stars,Pretty Good vacuumüëçüèΩ,"Only reason for not giving 5 stars is because I'm not a fan of the disposal feature... its a little difficult compared to the other vacuum I had...but otherwise, it's a great device."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great!,Great lower end robo vacuumm. It doesn‚Äôt have all the bells and whistles but it cleans the floors well and seems to get everything. Only issues is that it has difficulty getting some of the farther flung bedrooms occasionally.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Happy with my purchase,"Although the first one was giving random errors and was not following a certain cleaning pattern, replacement works really well. We are happy with its ease of use and how it navigates around the house. Powerful enough to collect most of the particles."
4.0 out of 5 stars,It works!,"It is amazing to me how much pet hair and dust this picks up! Occasionally it can't find it's way home and randomly gets stuck trying to go under the couch, but I would buy it again without hesitation. It's taken the mundane chore of sweeping and vacuuming away. I"
1.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth the money,"Very disappointed. Since it doesn't have a mapping system it's supposed smart guiding is terrible. It rarely gets all parts of the home clean, sits and spins in place, and if you reset it, it forgets where it is and you just have to dock it. Suction power is good but noise levels are a little high. Setup wasn't easy and you have to keep it connected to wifi 2.4, so if you have wifi 5 or higher it will be challenging."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Less work and better cleaning. This is a great product.,I loved everything about this vacuum. It has great suction power as well as battery life. I especially like how it can get under the beds and sweep up all the dust and cat hair. I always thought I was a thorough cleaner but I am amazed how much more the robot can do!!!
5.0 out of 5 stars,Why did I wait so long?,Very impressed with this entry-level robot vac. I was skeptical about buying it but happy I did. Cleans well and learns as it goes. Easy to clean and long battery time. Does a great job picking up dog hair. Recommended
3.0 out of 5 stars,Fine for what it does.,"Nice enough, seems to clean well. My only disappointment is I can not connect to it via WiFi because it works off the older 2 ghz pouters not the newer router."
4.0 out of 5 stars,Powerful suction. Hepa grabs more than my vacuum,Good suction and picks up more than a regular vacuum. It also mops but must bought separately
2.0 out of 5 stars,Was good at first,Worked great at first. Now after the return window has closed it is going crazy. Will no longer go in a straight line and now thinks something is blocking its wheels when there is nothing.
1.0 out of 5 stars,Lasted 5 months.  Good while it lasted.,"I bought this vacuum on Aug 2020. In Jan 2021 it stopped charging. The base charger has always been plugged into a surge protector. It cleaned well while it lasted. But 5 months is too little of a life for the $$, sorry. To be fair, we go through robot vacuums. I‚Äôve had 2 Neato‚Äôs, the Connected and the D5. Both lasted 2 years before having to be replaced. But you could easily replace their batteries. The Roborock is not accommodating in this regard either."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great vacuum for the price,"I owned this for a few weeks before I decided to upgrade to the S5. For a budget vacuum, you can‚Äôt beat the E4. It does a great job of picking up my dogs hair and it‚Äôs very efficient at doing so. It did well on hardwood floors and didn‚Äôt spread debris around like other vacuums. Would make a great gift."
3.0 out of 5 stars,The concept is good but it‚Äôs frustrating.,"I like the fact that we can have it run every day on a schedule, however, it keeps disconnecting from our WiFi even though nothing is wrong with our WiFi and that interrupts the schedule. Also, it‚Äôs not the greatest on carpeting. It kept saying it was stuck and I would go check and it was sitting In the middle of our floor with nothing around it. It tends to take a long time to find its way back to the dock."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Quick clean helper,So far does a good job for surface cleaning but not made for deep cleaning like the rainbow. Better than rumba at picking up dirt and crumbs.
2.0 out of 5 stars,This is a ‚Äúbasic b*tch‚Äù robot vaccum...,Loud af and the app doesn‚Äôt even do a map of where its been. Can‚Äôt create boundaries or off-limit areas. When I was setting up my account I got a 404 error. Who does that?
5.0 out of 5 stars,Very good brand and what a time saver! Great for taller thresholds,"After a few months of having this vacuum, its been great. Need to have the app though for complete control. Does not come with a remote."
1.0 out of 5 stars,Not good at picking up dog hair,"We got this for dog hair and it leaves like 40 percent of the dog hair on hard floors and 60 percent on carpet. Picture is after two passes. Great at picking up fruit loops, but we don't have a fruit loops problem."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great job on both wood and carpet!,My floors have never been cleaner! It just goes and goes. You can hear the power amp up when on the carpet vs the hardwood floor. It is thin enough to get under the bed and tv cabinets etc. Does well in the corners too.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it! Gets the job done!,"Have had this for over 3 months now and have been very happy with it. Tried other vacuums, but can really see and feel a difference with this one."
1.0 out of 5 stars,Not great enough to keep,Bought this vacuum hoping it‚Äôd work. Couldn‚Äôt handle regular duty stuff. Had a very hard time navigating around normal furniture and just missed tons of lines due to things like table legs.
1.0 out of 5 stars,Battery wouldn‚Äôt recharge after one month,This vacuum worked great at first then a month later it stopped taking a charge and won‚Äôt respond.
3.0 out of 5 stars,"Gets the job done, I guess","Relatively noisy but you can schedule to clean while you are gone. Suction power seemed ok, not very impressive but got the job done. App is not very user friendly, also the cleaning pattern is sporadic and not customizable. Decent vacuum overall but if you‚Äôre looking for a more interactive vacuum to map out your floor plan, look elsewhere. However, if you are looking for a slightly above average vacuum to wander aimlessly throughout your home (and mostly vacuum all the floors) then this one will suffice."
1.0 out of 5 stars,I had such high hopes!,"I paid almost $200 for this Unit. I cannot Connect to the unit through the app. I have no idea why. It tells you for reasons for not connecting however, none of that applies to me. I had such high hopes."
5.0 out of 5 stars,My little cleaning buddy,"Love my little buddy! I have the app and have programmed it to go off at night! Love that I can see where it has gone. Wished bumper strips came with it, but whatever.I'm shocked the amount of stuff it picked up from my 2cats 1dog 3 kids. Works better then my mothers high price robo vac."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Works well, no fuss.","Starting using this last month, so far it's been great. Move items out of the way for best performance, press the power button and let it go unattended. Came back to a well cleaned aptmt, dumped the container, and looked forward to the next time."
2.0 out of 5 stars,Preused and full of hair!,"My review come from the fact that when opened it was preused! The rollers, dust pan were full of dirt and tangled hair. I spent full price on a gift for my mother who has cancer to help her out and she has to deal with this. Had I known it would come preused first I wouldn't have spent this price and two I would have bought a different one. Absolutely nasty!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Game changer!,"Three weeks into using this vacuum, and I don‚Äôt know how I lived without it. Great suction. I love the mop function, perfect for a 1,000 sq ft tiled basement! Great to know that my floors will be cleaned while I continue working uninterrupted. A huge time saver. I highly recommend!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Definitely Worth it For Pet Hair,"Wish i would bought this sooner, i run it once a day keeps dog hair down. Better to dump container daily for best suction for dog hair."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love, love, love it!","I can not even express how much I love this vacuum. It works well, it is not to loud, it even gets under my couch. I know it is helping me have a healthier, less dusty home."
5.0 out of 5 stars,My new maid,Program it to clean at night and find your floors clean when you get up. This unit have a great price and it works just like the more expensive ones.Im very please with this little marvel.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Better than iRobot,"For the price this is an amazing vacuum! Compared to iRobot which my mom has, she says mine is better! It cleans in a pattern instead of sparatically and all over the place like iRobot. You can label the rooms once it learns it‚Äôs pattern. Overall, great buy and I‚Äôm very happy with the purchase!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Fantastic!,So far so good! Great suction and battery life. Bobby the robot is my little helper.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Pick up is excellent.,"I love this vacuum! It does an excellent job. I kind of wish I had but better one that I could map rooms with, but this one works very well. If I have to move it. It does get stuck once in a while, but I just move it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice suction & don‚Äôt miss a spot.,This is our 3rd robotic Vaccum cleaner. This is one of my favorites! I‚Äôd like to find out about the mop attachment. I‚Äôd be interested in getting that too. This Vaccuum saves us so much time.
5.0 out of 5 stars,This thing is amazing with pet hair!,"Having hardwood/vinyl floors this thing is amazing. Especially with pet hair. We have a husky, so this thing is a life saver. I really can‚Äôt rate it on carpet though."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect,Purchased to keep dog hair under control and it does a great job. Control via app. Purchased on sale during cyber Black Friday and was pleasantly surprised with performance.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Can handle lots of dog hair!,Love my robot vacuum. I had a different brand before this and returned it because it was all over the place and didn‚Äôt go in a pattern. This knows where it‚Äôs cleaned already and will move to spots that it hasn‚Äôt cleaned. I have two dogs (one golden one short haired mutt) and they shed sooo much and this little vacuum can handle it. It‚Äôs made cleaning so much easier for me. Absolutely love it!
5.0 out of 5 stars,I love this thing!,"I absolutely love this. I watch 3-6 kids everyday, there are always people in/out of my house, and I haven't vacuumed in 4 months. I would definitely buy this again."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Game changer for hardwood floors.,"I have it scheduled to clean at 730am, it takes a bit over an hour to do about 1000sqft at the balanced mode."
1.0 out of 5 stars,App doesn't work at all!,Don't waste your time. The app doens't work at all. Doesn't link with your phone. What a joke. Downloaded the manual and there is a different app to download and that won't install! Instructions are awful and not detailed on how to use this.
2.0 out of 5 stars,On and off,"Stopped working the first month. The wheels just stopped moving. We checked it and there was nothing blocking it. Also, I had to pick it up to go to another section of the house."
4.0 out of 5 stars,I would recommend,"For the price, this can't be beet. It works very well with my golden retriever dog and dark wood floors. It does get stock every once in a while on a carpet or hanging off the stairs"
1.0 out of 5 stars,Does not clean well,"We have been using it for couple of week now. This vaccum cleaner does not clean well. Often that it miss cleaning up small paper, dust etc. The corner/wall never get cleaned well. The program/mapping is also poor quality. At time it will only clean half the room and will return to base after incorrectly detecting that complete room cleaning is done."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"Great Vacuum, poor app and initiation. Loud.",Returned unit because the app features are poor and complicated to set up initially. It is a powerful vacuum and great when going over 1/2 inch cords such as surge protectors but it‚Äôs too loud for our liking
3.0 out of 5 stars,Won‚Äôt connect to Wi-Fi,Works well but cannot get it to connect to Wi-Fi! Has anyone else had thus issue? The reason I got it was specifically so that I could use the app on my phone.
5.0 out of 5 stars,never have dust on your feet again,"It wont pick up everytying, but it'll make your feet feel clean every time youre walking on your floors. Theres a huge decrease in dust and allergens in my house too. I got it when it was a bit pricey, but if this goes on sale, it's an immediate purchase. no brainer."
5.0 out of 5 stars,So great!,WHY did I not buy this before??! This little vacuum is amazing! I was very hesitant about buying one of these because I have two dogs and a cat...with a doggie door out to the yard. I did not think a robot vacuum would even make a dent on cleanliness...I was so wrong!
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product,This is the best vacuum hands down. The suction power is great and it navigates everywhere. Great on the tile floors and area rugs.
3.0 out of 5 stars,Good for dust bunny patrol,"Not enough suction for area rugs, but if you have laminate floors, it's great for helping keep the dust bunny herds under control."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Impressive,"I am very impressed with this. It cleans my whole house without issue. I had a shark before this one and although the shark did a good job, I love that this one does the perimeter anf then a back and forth pattern in each room. No more random. It's easy to clean and the app is very easy to use. My only regret, I didn't get the upgrade of the s4. üòä"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent robot vacuum!,"We had an IRoomba for a year and a half. It broke many times! This unit was less expensive, works incredibly and easy to maintain! We could not be happier with it in a household with 6 dogs! If I could give it more stars I would! Thank you! Would definitely purchase again! We bought in 10/24/20."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Best purchase I‚Äôve made!,Got this Late in my pregnancy and was the best purchase I‚Äôve ever made. Especially now that our baby is here I couldn‚Äôt imagine trying to find the time to vacuum. We have 3 cats it gets all the hair and kitty litter off the floors (rug and hardwood) it will get under our bed and dressers where i couldn‚Äôt ever reach before. It‚Äôs fairly quiet and the app is easy to use. I‚Äôm very happy with it!
5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Budget Robot Vac,Actually maps out your house and goes along a grid. Other budget robot vacuums just bounce around randomly like a pinball machine. The app is not very good though.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Idk bout Alexa but worth the money and love it!,"I have two dogs, lab golden retriever mixes. This thing works great. I was skeptical with some of the negative videos but I run this everyday on my carpet and hard wood floors while I get ready for work, very happy I bought this one. (Will suck up underwear if left on floor and phone cord if on ground but will stop until you unwrap it)"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Works great right out of the box,This robot works great right out of the box - didn't bother connecting it to WiFi because wtf does my vacuum need to know where I live and such
1.0 out of 5 stars,Crazy robot,This machine is just not what I expected. It does not suction like we expected at all and the machine has to be redirected to go back to the base over and over.
5.0 out of 5 stars,This product is awesome. Totally worth the money,"I was a little skeptical buying this product initially, not sure how it would do in a large house that has weird angles and decorative items on the floor(some are fragile). My husband and I both are amazed at what an excellent job it does of picking up on our hardwood and tile floors. I only wish I‚Äôd bought the one that also mops so I‚Äôll probably buy a second one."
4.0 out of 5 stars,Vacuums better than it sweeps - this model doesn‚Äôt bring the Moo but u can buy that separately,Compared to another brand... it doesn‚Äôt sweep corners... good part is that it‚Äôs so easy to clean!!! Way easy! Big canister compared to others as well.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome vac .,I have a German Shepherd dog and this robovac rocks . Use it everyday and it is so powerful it really cleans well. Way better than my deebot and I really liked that one too. Buy it you won‚Äôt be disappointed.
1.0 out of 5 stars,Very unhappy - poor controls and constantly gets stuck,This RoboRock vacuum is very poor. I suggest avoiding it entirely. I purchased a iRobot after all kinds of frustrations with this and they are significantly better and well worth the additional cost. Save the frustrations with buying a very poor product and get something that actually works.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Easy to use. Cleans well!,Does a great job of cleaning. Don‚Äôt have Alexa but programs easily to phone. Really pretty quiet. Easily carry on conversation OT listen to Tv while vacuuming.
4.0 out of 5 stars,Helpful,I like it but I was under the impression that it would keep a memory of the rooms it goes in but not so. Sometimes it returns to the port without entering all the rooms.
3.0 out of 5 stars,complicated WIFI connection.,It has excellent suction and reaches all the corners. It cleans vey well. Only negative is that it is VERY hard to connect to WIFI so using the app has been a struggle. I have not been able to set a schedule due to this.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Working good !,Cheap price on Thanksgiving day but working good. Battery is another fact that I like it. Best on hardwood floor not on carpet. Would recommend to everyone.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent technology, good customer service","This model was just released this year and encompasses a lot of new technology, and it shows. It moves with ease in our one bedroom apartment and it‚Äôs quiet enough to function while we are still there. It looks really slick and the components are well-built. In addition, I am extremely happy with their customer service and how they handled any little issue I had. We have both carpet and hardwood in our apartment and this could handle both."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Espectscular,"Todo me agrada un poco de ruido pero nada insoportable, es una excelente soluci√≥n que todas las mujeres deb√≠an tener para cuidar m√°s de si misma. Estoy muy feliz"
1.0 out of 5 stars,Not to smart,"You have to babysit otherwise, he will get stuck under the couch, under the dishwasher etc‚Ä¶ save your money!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,I got ripped off and want a full refund,Your application to download will not download to my iOS device to control device
4.0 out of 5 stars,Super Helper,Purchase a cheaper one prior to this and regrets. This was THE BEST buy ever for my home. I have carpet and hardwood floors this machine works GREAT!!
2.0 out of 5 stars,Robot vacuum mediocre at best,"Was not very hard to set up, but it really struggles to not get stuck somewhere and then when I free it up it does not know how to get back to base to recharge. I wish there was a way to view what it has mapped durring its runs so you can edit it and help tell it where to avoid."
1.0 out of 5 stars,Died after one month,Have no idea what is wrong with it. It was working so so for about a month then it went back to the charger after a cleaning and won't turn on again.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent to handle my 2 dogs!,"My entire house is hardwood floors. I have a chow and a husky and need to vacuum at least once a day to stay on top of the hair, Berta( yes, we named the vacuum ) has been doing a great job!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product!!!!! Works to good,¬†This thing really amazes me and lessons my duty! Such a great addition. I swept and mopped the floor thoroughly and it still got stuff! Worth the money
5.0 out of 5 stars,Roborock E4 Rocks! üëç,"We love our Roborock E4! We cleaned our entire home yesterday and this robot vacuum did a thorough job and it was fun to watch it go from room to room doing it‚Äôs magic! The only negative is that this particular model will not integrate with Alexa, but that‚Äôs ok! It does have a very nice app, that we downloaded; and good remote control features! Overall, a great product at a great price! üëçüôÇ"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great!,"Works great on hardwood floors, wouldn‚Äôt recommend for medium/high pile carpet. But other than that it‚Äôs perfect!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Best robo cleaner in this price range,"The product is great, better than the one (another brand) I had before. It maps the floor line by line, and picks up junk really well. Also bought this as XFX to congratulate XiaoZhan as the spokesperson."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I love it!,It picks up allllllll the dog hair and even sand.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Best time-saver,Literally cannot live without it. We‚Äôve only had it for about a month but it‚Äôs saved me from having to vacuum a total of 286 times so far LOL. Wish the mop worked better but most likely will just buy a second robot for that. We have 2 toddlers and giant German Shepherd and the vacuum works amazing with all the hair and crumbs.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Good product, bad packaging","I just got this thing and seems great so far. The packaging, however, is not so good. The box is so difficult to pull from the shipping box, I got large paper cut from the box. Be careful!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect sidekick for keeping home clean!,So far so good! We received our Roborock 3 weeks ago and it‚Äôs been amazing thus far! The dust bin is very easy to remove & empty. The suction must be very powerful because it‚Äôs always collecting even the smallest dust and dirt particles from inbetween wooden floor board indents. Wish we had this sooner! Highly recommend getting one of these. I haven‚Äôt had the opportunity to use the mopping feature yet but looking forward to trying that out as well. I believe I may need to purchase an additional part for that feature.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Excelente para la persona que labora fuera √≥ la que no est√° en condici√≥n por salud .,"Muy bueno para limpieza cont√≠nua y su alcance queda bien limpio. La dejas programada para limpieza, me encant√≥."
4.0 out of 5 stars,Pretty smart,Works pretty well actually. Don't let it get on your hide rugs. It got tangled in my wildebeest rug (mane) but otherwise works nice
4.0 out of 5 stars,Ok robot vacuum,The app for the phone is what has been difficult. And the battery seems to run out quickly. We have had the vacuum since October of 2020 and it has done an ok job but we haven't been able to get it to run on specific directions just on the clean mode it hasn't configured our house and memorized rooms or furniture.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Does the job,"Great little machine. Does a wonderful job at cleaning our textured vinyl flooring. So far, no complaints."
5.0 out of 5 stars,It sucks good,"I have owned 4 robot vacuums. I always thought my Shark 750 was the best, until now. This Roborock E4 tops all of them. It doesn't get stuck, it always finds it way back home. Most of all it really does suck in a good way."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Suction a bit low#,"The suction power lacks a bit, but with 2 passes will take care of the leftover dogs hair, other than that, the wifie loves it!"
3.0 out of 5 stars,Battery life is very short,"I have a rumba 650 that I have had for 3 years and it works great. I recently purchase this vacuum for my 2nd home which is 90 percent laminate flooring. The mop feature works as stated, the vacuum suction is good. The only thing that I am dissatisfied with is the battery life is terrible. The unit needs to be charged after doing one room. I would recommend a rumba over this unit and forgo the mop feature for better battery life."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Best robot vacuum without LIDAR technology!,"This is the best robot without LIDAR in my opinion. Love how it cleans in straight lines rather than bouncing around randomly. It knows where it‚Äôs cleaned, so it runs until the cleaning is complete rather than until the battery dies. In fact, I‚Äôve never had the battery die on me yet - the lowest it‚Äôs ever gotten to is 42%. If you have a dog that sheds, you need to get the Roborock E4."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice gift! My friend is released from housework,"Quiet, effective in cleaning every corner."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great cleaner for the price,"It you don't mine not have all the bells and whistles, and want a very powerful vac with great battery life this is for you. The money you save you can buy one for up stairs and down. Good job Roborock!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Best little helper,Love love it! We use it twice a day and started leaving shoes outside. I use mopping attachment every other day with light water/vinegar/essential oil mixture. Our floors have never been cleaner and it truly lifts the spirits
4.0 out of 5 stars,Pretty good overall,"Mine can't seem to find it's way home. I followed the instructions to the letter, but when I hit ""return home"" it just goes in circles. Not sure how to fix this."
3.0 out of 5 stars,Navigation is its only downfall,Would not return to the home base. Tried and tried and got the tech support on the phone and we could not figure it out. Sent it back
5.0 out of 5 stars,I dig it.,"I like it‚Äôs cleaning algorithm; our little robot scuttled back and forth in a zig-zag pattern that covers the entire floor pretty well. I can use the app anywhere to initiate cleanup, though I can only use other remote functions (spot cleaning, steering) when I share WiFi."
1.0 out of 5 stars,Don‚Äôt even think about it,Don‚Äôt get this. The algorithm is terrible it doesn‚Äôt figure out a room in an open space
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great pickup, long batter life...so far very happy!",Saving my life so to speak as far as vacuuming! Big vacuumshurt my back & my old robo version gave out. Needed a reasonable priced version. This one works GREAT!
4.0 out of 5 stars,So far so good. Too thick to commit suicide by going under the railing.,Decent vacuum. My previous one from eufy fell down the stairs despite advertising that it wouldn't. This one also does a better job vacuuming.
2.0 out of 5 stars,Confused vacuum.,It picked up really well but the quiet mode didn‚Äôt work on ours so it was really loud. It also frequently wouldn‚Äôt dock because it couldn‚Äôt find it. It also frequently would get turned around so it would vacuum the same section over and over again. Had to return it.
4.0 out of 5 stars,Pleased with Battery Life and Vacuum Operations.,Only issue is there is little to No information on downloading suitable software (several available) and never have been able to make ROOM Function operate. No good instruction manual or tips and No trouble shooting assistance. However overall were pleased with basic features.
1.0 out of 5 stars,Roborock E4,I returned this robotic vac just didn't work good for me. It would get lost and not return to charger.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Highly Recommend,I LOVE this product!! So easy to use and has great suction! I have a lot of pet hair and running this helps keep it down!
5.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn‚Äôt tumble downstairs!!!,¬†I am in love with it. The best part is that it doesn‚Äôt tumble downstairs ü•∞
3.0 out of 5 stars,Clumsier than expected,"The large gaps on the sides involving the front bumper ""hooked"" up too often on wood furniture such as chair legs while turning in place. This hooking caused it to jump and thump way to often. Also ran into darker colored furniture without slowing down first."
3.0 out of 5 stars,Not what I was hoping for,Little disappointed that the app was so useless. Have to lift all the rugs of the floor to mop and babysit it so it wouldn‚Äôt fall down stairs. It had a hard time docking. After 5 days it kept dropping the brush and plastic cover over the brush and caused scratches on my hardwood. When I tried to move the docking station the adhesive that held the plastic ring to the floor under the dock lifted off a layer of hardwood.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent cleaning robot.,It works really well. When it gets to the carpet the suction increases and it cleans really well.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great cleaner,Love how it cleans corners and baseboards. Much easier to clean out dust tray. Noise level is a little higher than my last robot but I love this one.
4.0 out of 5 stars,works so well but came full of someone else's dirt!,"I know it was a used Amazon warehouse deal, however I didn't expect it to come with the dust bin literally full of someone else's dirt! Come on you have to do better than that Amazon!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,This is a great Vacuum!!,"This is a great Vacuum, I love it. Works great around the house without any problem, I really recommend it to everyone."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Fantastic Purchase,We love our Roborock vacuum. This is our first robot vacuum but will definitely not be our last. The suction could be better on the carpet but we got it mainly to help with upkeep for the hardwood on the main floor. It has been fantastic and has taken such a burden off of having to constantly clean up animal fur and crumbs from my two boys. Would highly recommend this purchase to anyone and would be happy to purchase from Roborock again.
1.0 out of 5 stars,App doesn't work.,"The vacuum wouldn't work with the app, wouldn't connect to my Wi-Fi. The vacuum still works without it, but minus all the features."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great vacuum,"I had an off shoot robotic vacuum that lasted 3 years - it could not adjust from hard wood to carpet , this does easily. My other had no idea where it was going most of the time . This one has the room lay out perfect. It works great with Alexa. ‚ÄúAlexa turn on robot ‚Äú off it goes to complete its cleaning ! Love it"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Omg,Love everything about this little thing especially that it can vacuum instead of me. Actually it does better job than myself.
1.0 out of 5 stars,A hands free attention sucking vacuum,"If you can't baby sit it, don't buy it. It's faster and more efficient to use your old push vaccuum. Save your money."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product for the price,It's a great product for the price. I've had another one different brand which died when my nephew sat on it. I had to get a new one and this one is tough and very efficient.
2.0 out of 5 stars,Not so good for carpet,Worked ok but couldn't handle carpet.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Glad I bought it,I am very pleased with my new ROBOROCK E4. After investigating various brand in a similar price range and decided to try Roborock. With three cats and a large house I must say that the vacuum did a great job. This is my first robot vacuum and I am really happy that I took the chance. It definitely makes my life a lot easier and its fun.
4.0 out of 5 stars,Great vacuum,"I like it,I just wish the water resovour was bigger.I still haven't used it to mop yet,because I have a lot of square footage to cover."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"It goes over everything, never gets stuck",Perfect little vaccum. It understands and maps the house perfectly even without lidar. It also navigates obstacles great and goes over hurdles with ease.
4.0 out of 5 stars,I like,I have run the unit just a few times and it already knows it‚Äôs way around my house. Suction could be a kitty better and it‚Äôs a bit noisy. But overall I‚Äôm pretty pleased with this one.
4.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing,Absolutely love this vacuum. It has been a game changer for our house. I feel so much relief knowing that my floors are clean. The only issue I have found is that it doesn‚Äôt get corners well and it misses a few things here and there but overall a fantastic buy!
1.0 out of 5 stars,Not impressed,"Ok, I've had this thing for a couple months now and I can say it is not worth the money. It's has not been able to complete a full cycle of cleaning, ever. I guess if you remove every piece of furniture in the entire house it will still get stuck under something. Do not waste your money on this."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth the money,This smart robot frees me from vacuum the floor. The suction power is strong enough for my carpet and hardwood floors!
5.0 out of 5 stars,My Little Pal,This thing works so well it's hard not to fell affectionate toward it. Watching it search across the floor for another spot to get clean is very satisfying.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Roborock Is Now A Member Of The Family,"Roborock has been coined ""Roborick"" in our family. Our 2 year old son loves him, and could consider him his best friend. Roborick doesn't feel the same."
1.0 out of 5 stars,I could not connnect to wfi,I sent the item bck. It would not connect to Alexa not detect on my Wifi
1.0 out of 5 stars,The advertisement is a lie,"Seems like a reliable fantastic Piece of equipment, works really well with phones, however there is no mapping, I repeat NO MAPPING! Which I wouldn‚Äôt mode if the advertisement did not include the mapping and I bough it for mapping which it doesn‚Äôt have."
4.0 out of 5 stars,Great product,Love this product.
5.0 out of 5 stars,‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è,"Exactly what I needed. Simple to use, works very well and completely worth the price. I‚Äôm always amazed at the amount of dirt/dust I empty from the bin each time I use it. We have 3 pets and this helps me keep the home neat and tidy."
2.0 out of 5 stars,Does not connect to wifi,I‚Äôve done everything I can find on the internet and this thing will NOT connect to my wifi. Super frustrating.
3.0 out of 5 stars,DOES NOT WORK WITH AMAZON ALEXA,"DOES NOT WORK WITH AMAZON ALEXA. I bought this because I thought I could use Alexa, but the Alexa skill only supports S series"
4.0 out of 5 stars,Not completely as advertised,The alexa integration could be better. Not exactly as expected. But better than the e4 by far and worth the extra money.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Works great!,"sucks up all dog hair, even along baseboard. Frees self when stuck; easily transitions over and increases power to clean door mats and area rugs. It will suck up anything on floor so make sure toys, socks, cords are put away!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Best purchase ever made,"Best purchase I have ever made for myself! I am a new mom with 4 dogs. Not only does the vacuum free up time, and keep my house clean, it‚Äôs also great entertainment for my baby!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome vacuum!,"We love this vacuum!! I initially purchased it for my parents but we decided to try it out to make sure it would work for them. And then it worked so well we decided to keep it! Works well on our hardwood floors, area rugs, and carpet. Highly recommend!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,Useless: Wanders around aimlessly. Never learns the room or obstacles  Weak suction,Never figures out the room unless its an empty simple space.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Works better than I expected,"It picks up almost all things. It is very thorough! I'm glad it is smart enough not to fall off the stairs. It's very easy to use, and it's light to carry around. It's pretty incredible how it is able to flick pieces of dirt out of corners and crevices."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Buena üëç inversi√≥n,El Roborock E4 le encanta a mi esposa soluciona grandes problema q dejan nuestras mascotas y sus accesorios son una maravilla ya q la compa√±√≠a por problema de log√≠stica no llegaron al principio. Pero los hicieron llegar a tiempo para complacer a su clientes y quedar en bien alto su buen nombre como empresa
2.0 out of 5 stars,It's bottom of middle of the pack,It's OK but stick with known brands for this. Not reliable to get everything vacuumed as needed.
2.0 out of 5 stars,My WiFi was good enough...,I guess my carpet wears the thing out before it does very much. Not enough umph in the battery. And without really good strong WiFi it won't go far from the base. Probably works good on hard floors and strong WiFi. I'm nonplussed.
2.0 out of 5 stars,Bad at vaccuuming large/multiple rooms,Great for single room cleaning. This robot fails to recognize adjacent rooms.
4.0 out of 5 stars,Useful little vacuum!,"This little vacuum works well! The suction is very good for such a small machine! It took it a few tries to map out my house well enough to get it covered, but once it did, I was impressed. The remote control function is a little clunky, but for the price compared to other robot vacuums, this little machine is worth it!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Good suction power,"This is my first robot vacuum that I have so I don't have any counterpart to compare with, but this robot is pretty good. It has a very good suction power. The only complain that I have is that it takes a lot of time to clean the house, and I think it is because it cleans some of the areas of the house several times."
2.0 out of 5 stars,It's good vacuum but issue with base,It has a good suction power and does have a systematic way of cleaning. It can be controlled remotely and will keep on alarming you if having an issue.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Does a thorough job!,"I haven't used the Alexa features but I can tell you that I am very pleased. It's ""smart"" and methodical...suction is good...does a thorough job!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Just about perfect,"Dogs and kids, furniture and other things everywhere. Rarely gets stuck, usually figures the rooms out and does a good cleaning wherever it can get to. I really like it. Was a great value!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Cleans deep dirt and fine dog hair! So quiet!,We like everything - so does Sweetie our pup of 16 years.
5.0 out of 5 stars,WOW,"i gotta say, "" very pleased ""."
5.0 out of 5 stars,For rugs not wood floors.,The problem for me I have wood floors not rugs which whay the this vacuum is for!!#
1.0 out of 5 stars,Chinese crap,"I could not use the product because the setup, through online software does not work. Three days wasted trying to get this setup. All they want is my phone number and address."
5.0 out of 5 stars,AMAZING!!!,This vacuum is amazing!!!!!! I love it!!! It took a bit to connect to the wifi but after some refreshing it worked. It scanned the entire house and easily transitions from carpet to the flooring.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Employee of the month,One of the best purchases of my life. Quiet. Doesn't run into everything like a drink toddler like my mom's shark. Very impressed by Roborock.
4.0 out of 5 stars,I love my robovac. He never leaves a job half done.,Alexa integration is rough. The only real ability is gives is to say start cleaning or return to doc. No control over zones or where it goes. The over all usefulness of this vacume is great though.
1.0 out of 5 stars,Very disappointing,"Very pathetic product. I upgraded from a evobot thinking this is a step up, but this would get stuck on our regular size carpet and make a weird cleaning pattern. Will be returning it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Good Cleaner,Cleans very well. My only complaint is that it will go over some places twice before it docks.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Best robot vacuum,This is by far the best robot vacuum cleaner I‚Äôve purchased! I had the Roomba 960 and the e5 previously and this one is far better than both and much cheaper.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth it,Bought this on impulse when it was on flash deals. It‚Äôs wonderful and works great! Easy to use and clean.
5.0 out of 5 stars,So worth it!,"Overall, really great product. We don‚Äôt really have to do any extra vacuuming or sweeping which saves us soooo much time! We got it during cyber Monday, so got a really great price on it and worth every penny!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"No remote control, problem adding to Wi-Fi","Suction, battery life and noise level good. I couldn‚Äôt add it to my wi-fi network. Called CS Rep but they couldn‚Äôt help either. Returned the item next day."
3.0 out of 5 stars,Walmart has this product for $248 and it comes with the mop,"The product works great and we love running it through our apartment every 2 days, sometimes daily! However, I returned the one I bought from Amazon as it did not come with the mop attachment and totaled close to $430. I found this exact same model, mop and all, at Walmart for $248 and it came with the mop attachment."
2.0 out of 5 stars,I‚Äôm sorry I missed my deadline for returning it!,"It gets stuck under edges of furniture, appliances, etc., and takes forever, IF ever, to release itself. Realizing it‚Äôs not meant to replace a vacuum cleaner, it cleans well enough, but I don‚Äôt recommend it and wish I hadn‚Äôt missed my return day by only 2 days!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,So Far So Good,It‚Äôs better than what I expected so far. I will update my review in couple weeks.
4.0 out of 5 stars,Good,Works great. Some getting stuck.. but learning curve
2.0 out of 5 stars,"Roborock E4 Robot Vacuum Cleaner,","Good robotic vacuum, however the software is horrible for trying to get it to link to MIHOME website and to therefore access home wifi."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it!,"Love this. Works well. It isn‚Äôt silent but, it isn‚Äôt loud. Wish I had purchased years ago. Love the phone alerts."
3.0 out of 5 stars,Good suction but garbage app,We downloaded the app and followed the email instructions but the t doesn‚Äôt work. The only way it will vacuum is by pressing the button on the unit. Not what we wanted at all. Expected it to be easy to use.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great value,"Worth every penny. I have long hair and I shed everywhere. I also have a cat who sheds a lot. This vacuum does an amazing job at vacuuming everything up especially under my bed. I like how once it‚Äôs done, it goes back to the docking station. It‚Äôs very easy to clean too. The app is very easy to use."
1.0 out of 5 stars,Make it impossible to return and get a refund.,Totally misrepresented.
3.0 out of 5 stars,Definitely generic,I‚Äôm not impressed. Had it for 3 mi the and it barely picks anything up. It can‚Äôt figure out the rooms. It‚Äôll do a 4 foot strip and then move onto the next room. I‚Äôve reset and fine troubleshooting without success.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great vacuum!,It works great and picks up more than I imagined it would. Very satisfied so far
5.0 out of 5 stars,Roborock,"I was not sure if I would like it, but I love it!!!! It really cleans the floor"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Decent robocleaner,I like it it doesn't deep clean obviously but can pick up sufficiently for every day.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great,"Does a great job, if it holds up it will be tremendous, wish it had more app options but I love it"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for bird owners,If you own birds or other messy small animals this vacuum will save you. I went from having perpetually dirty floors that I swept constantly to having clean floors without any effort on my part. Best purchase I have ever made.
1.0 out of 5 stars,If only it sucked,"We have another RoboRock vacuum that we love so I felt confident buying the same brand. This product regularly gets‚Äùstuck‚Äù in the middle of the room with nothing around it. ‚Äúerror code 8‚Äù. Buy this and get ready to hear that a lot. Don‚Äôt recommend. I‚Äôve rebooted it, updated firmware, called customer service, reloaded the app... you name it. This thing sucks."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Best in class,This may be the best robotic vacuum in its class for the price.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great vacuum!,I love this thing. With my house being completely tiled from wall to wall. It sure saves me a LOT of time not having to clean my floors manually every time.
4.0 out of 5 stars,Does excellent on the hardwood.,Does excellent on the hardwood floors but has trouble with the rugs. Either the little brush gets tangled up or it will just fault out.
5.0 out of 5 stars,nice little robot,"this is nice little robot, with strong suction power. does its job quite well"
4.0 out of 5 stars,Great,"I love it. It definitely makes like easier. There are times though where you will look for it around the house where it gets stuck under a couch or bed. The app is not great but works. It sometimes can't find its way home or searches every where for home and I decide to help little guy get home instead of it taking all day to get back to the charger, but I almost never sweep anymore."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it,Excellent robot vacuum. Doesn't get stuck as others vacuums of it's price Clean so well and the hair doesn't tangled.
2.0 out of 5 stars,Meh,Vac was okay. Not worth $200+ for me. The actual vacuum brush width is small and in the middle of the machine so it is limited in what it can reach. It missed a lot more than I expected.
3.0 out of 5 stars,Buggy software,"It cleans ok but quite often it will go back to its dock after a cleaning and ""go offline"". It will then report as ""offline"" in the app and will not clean per the schedule until i go press the power button. Then it looks like it powers on again and things work ok for another week or so."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I have photos of all process to connect but it‚Äôs place for just one,"Unable to connect to the wifi and setting was done correctly, looks electronic problem"
4.0 out of 5 stars,It‚Äôs a good vacuum,I would buy this item again. It‚Äôs a little tall for my kitchen cabinets sometimes it rubs. It‚Äôs fairly noisy but what vacuum isn‚Äôt? It‚Äôs not much good for washing floors lMO. I am a long coated dog family. We still need to manually vacuum once weekly. In this house that‚Äôs BIG
4.0 out of 5 stars,My daughter says it sucks-literally üòÇüòÇin a good way!,I purchased this for my daughter. She is very happy with it and only uses it on Carpet. That‚Äôs why I did not comment about the hardwood floors.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Rocky works!,It really works for my in between cleaning when I need a quick floor sweep. I go shopping and it‚Äôs done. I do remove obstacles to make it easier for ‚ÄúRocky‚Äù to get to all the space. Sometimes it gets stuck on the rug. I haven‚Äôt used the mop yet. I‚Äôm loving it...
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great with mop attachment,"Keeps my floors looking great, you need to get the mop attachment seperately but its a must have and not too expenssive."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great powerful cleaning machine,Love how well it cleans and it's ability to go over my area rugs and under my couches
5.0 out of 5 stars,My first vacum robot,"This is one of the best things that I've ever bought. Affordable vacum robot, excellent battery life, excellent suction power also with pet hair (I have 3 dogs); it doesn't miss a single spot in your house and in case it does you can check it in the cleaning story at the mi home app."
1.0 out of 5 stars,Don't waste your money on this one.,Worthless. Very weak suction. Gets stuck under furniture. Won't pair with my phone. There are no settings you can change on the vacuum. Very disappointed. Returning it.
5.0 out of 5 stars,How did I get along without this?,"I love my robovac. It does an excellent job and I can go about my business and have clean floors. The only thing that I don't like is it gets stuck under my storage trunk it's not quit tall enough to go completely under it, but that's it."
1.0 out of 5 stars,Worse product I ever bought.,I tried to give it a few weeks and a few cleanings before deciding it was as bad as I thought! By time I asked for replacement they said it was too late. Lemon!
4.0 out of 5 stars,gets stuck,keeps house clean twice a day
3.0 out of 5 stars,"Good vacuum, could have better suction",The vacuum works well however I still use my traditional vacuum to do a through job. Works well in between deep cleaning
5.0 out of 5 stars,vacuum suction is great,When I first got it I didn't think I would like it because I'm very picky on how my floors are done but surprisingly it does a good job. I do a once a week deep cleaning and use the vacuum as a daily cleaning keep up
2.0 out of 5 stars,Dies not link with alexa.,Seems to do fine. One thing I was excited about was the compatibility with alexa. Roborock own app isn't even compatible with it you have to get mihouse app which isn't compatible with alexa at all. Decent for the price I suppose.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great help,I love my robot vacuum. I have a bad back. Even the lightweight vacuums hurt my back due to the movement My robot vacuum allows me to have a clean floor without injuring myself.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect and Fast Delivery too!,Perfect and Fast Delivery too!
1.0 out of 5 stars,Avoid this product as it's not reliable for long-term,Worked great for the first couple months. The vacuum keeps having an error 7 issue. Based on my inspection it appears the mechanism for one of the wheels is broken. Company is terrible with communication and no help.
3.0 out of 5 stars,Too loud,Does a fair job of cleaning.
4.0 out of 5 stars,Great product,Great vacum but the app sucks
4.0 out of 5 stars,Vacuum ability,Works great on my hardwood floors. A little noisy. Only other complaint is that I can't get my husband to stop playing with it. It's like a new toy. Haven't tried the wet vac feature yet
5.0 out of 5 stars,PERFECT!!! WOW WOW WOW,"I'm in love with these robots, lol! Wow, all I can say!"
2.0 out of 5 stars,"Basic cleaning okay, otherwise unreliable","We have a carpeted floor and this can do basic cleaning but struggles navigating on to a rug (which is where we need more cleaning). After only a couple of cleans it keeps erroring out saying ""error 4 wipe the sensors clean"". Remote control doesn't work as well. Really disappointed"
3.0 out of 5 stars,Too much dog hair,"I have two big dogs that shed a ton and a canary that likes to throw his birdseed all over the place. The unit just didn‚Äôt seem to be able to keep up with the hair and bird seeds. I wish I did‚Ä¶.,"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Vacuum,This mid range vacuum competes with the high end vacuums. Great for larger homes.
4.0 out of 5 stars,Pet approved,Good suction and good space for the trash it collects. Only complaint is that the filter is always ‚Äúwet‚Äù which it‚Äôs not... I have a dog and three cats and it does a 3.5 stars in cleaning up the hairs and cat litter.
3.0 out of 5 stars,Battery dies very soon,"The battery cannot last 200min at all. The machine can only work 1 hour after fully charged. Dust sticks inside the machine, hard to clean it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Simple pleasures of having clean floors instantly,Love this!!! Makes my life so much easier.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great vacumn,Way better than the Romba I have. Cleans without the banging into furniture.

5.0 out of 5 stars,Great vacuum!,I love this vacuum. It really does a great job. I like it so much that I ordered my daughter her second one as she has a large house. I'm then going to order each of my three sisters one. Great product that I highly recommend.

1.0 out of 5 stars,Don't buy!,"Very disappointed! Was really expecting this to be a good vacuum and for the first 3 months it worked okay on pur carpet, but now it doesn't even pick up a small piece of paper towel. Now I can't even return it or exchange it because it's been past the return date. I do not recommend this at all."

5.0 out of 5 stars,I can't believe I waited so long to get this.,"I absolutely LOVE this. I was hesitant for so long to get one because of the number of dogs I have. It hasn't been a problem at all. In fact, a life saver. I have hardwood floors, and area rugs, and this transitions perfect from one to the other. Another thing I really like about it is how easy it is to clean. All the pieces come out and you can was them, and wipe out the interior."
4.0 out of 5 stars,Overall great job.,"Still pretty new. Does a good job, but had a mind of its own."
4.0 out of 5 stars,Works well with a flaw. App connection is tough to get set up.,Works well. Does a good job. My one issue was took alot of messing with the app to get it all to connect vfinally got the app to work. That's the main drawback.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Dog hair,Where has this been all my life? Best thing I have ever bought for myself.
1.0 out of 5 stars,It only mops for an hour,"The manual is so lame and doesn't help with the set up. Their website is even worse. The app says create a ""scene"" but nothing says how and on the website when you search ""scene"" nothing comes up. wouldn't buy again."
2.0 out of 5 stars,E robot,It‚Äôs more of a hassle. Always lost and caught
1.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn‚Äôt work,I‚Äôve had it for several months now and it just spins around in circles in the same location.

5.0 out of 5 stars,Best investment,"I absolutely LOVE my Roborock. The best investment I have made for my hone in a long time. I have an in home daycare and gave to vacuum every evening. It has been a back saver. A couple times it has hung up and went dead trying to get loose, but I would recommend it to anyone."
4.0 out of 5 stars,Me super encanto,"Me encanto es mi super amiga me ahorra bastante trabajo , limpia bien el piso lo √∫nico es que no pude configurar la a alexaüòîüòîüòî pero ahun as√≠ SUPER MEGA RECOMENDADAüòçüòçüòç"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Might be good, but Amazon delivered a heavily used product.","Can‚Äôt actually review the roborock because Amazon delivered one that was pretty heavily used (see pictures). So I‚Äôd say, buy this from the producer of the product itself, not from Amazon."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"It's working, but not efficient neither intelligent","I expect the product can be set to clean the whole house, but very disappointedly, I have to do it manually to guide it to go to the rooms need cleaning. The app is suck. Chinese product, not recommend at all"
4.0 out of 5 stars,Cleans well,"Does a good job of cleaning on our laminate floors, and has no trouble navigating the throw rugs. I've downloaded the app, but I can't get connected to my phone. I would have given 5 stars if that part worked as advertised."

5.0 out of 5 stars,I like this model.,"My ""Mr. Belvedere"" does a nice job but tends to skip spots in rooms with lots of obstacles. He also gets lost when sent home."
4.0 out of 5 stars,Stops in the middle of the room,"The only problem I have had is the vacuum will stop in the middle of the room and ""announce' to remove objects in it's way. I have to push the resume button for it to continue. It does this at least 4 times during it's cleaning process. It is annoying but I like it otherwise."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Works great,Works great

2.0 out of 5 stars,"Decent robot vacuum, but won't return to dock","The Roborock E4 vacuum does a reasonable job of cleaning - good cleaning logic and decent suction. The main issue is that it will not return to its dock after cleaning. Mine has cleaned approximately 15 times over 2 months, and never found its dock. Roborock customer service has been responsive but unable to help me resolve the issue."

5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome,Best vacuum ever. Love coming home to fresh vacuum lines.
5.0 out of 5 stars,limpia muy bien,me gusta el poder de succion q tiene
5.0 out of 5 stars,Not the best suction but a good value,Vacuum power is considerable less than my old neato but it is a good value as it works well otherwise.
1.0 out of 5 stars,It gets stuck all the time. You have to manually move it so no purpose of having a robot.,Very disappointed!! Gets stuck everywhere. App isn‚Äôt so good. No ‚Äúavoid areas‚Äù feature. Not for me üòí
2.0 out of 5 stars,Don‚Äôt waste your money,"The vacuum works pretty well. The problem is this things ability to navigate around your house. In the first three hours of having it, we had to help it get unstuck several times. All the effort needed to assist this thing, you might as well just vacuum your house. Sending it back."
4.0 out of 5 stars,really like this unit I am impressed with it. app will not work as of yet.,since I have gotten this I have used it every day. it works very well and it is really fantastic to check this off of my things to do list daily. one thing I cannot get to work is the app. it will not set up. still working on this.
5.0 out of 5 stars,GREAT PURCHASE!,This is one of the best purchases that I have been this year. Reasonable price compared to other brands. It works GREAT! It cleans in alignment and you can receive text notifications to your phone anywhere anytime if it gets stuck or when it‚Äôs done cleaning etc.

5.0 out of 5 stars,You need this. No gimmick.,This thing is incredible. It‚Äôs a substantial unit with considerable heft and power. I let it go in my carpeted bedroom and an hour later (and 2 emptying of the reservoir) and I had a PILE of all kinds of nasty stuff. Going under the beds is a key advantage. Love this thing.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Pretty good vacuum for price,This vacuum helps a lot especially with an endlessly shedding dog
5.0 out of 5 stars,Works great!,"We have 2 chocolate labs, they shed a lot and bring in pine needles and dirt from outside. This vacuum gets it all!"

5.0 out of 5 stars,Good customer service!,*Update:
5.0 out of 5 stars,It's a smart robot. Do not regret at all,What I would add is a man and child voices for the robot.
5.0 out of 5 stars,OMG,I call it Jev's! He cleans my floors better than my regular vacuum.
2.0 out of 5 stars,Does Not  work with alexa,"It vacuumed great. It will not sync with alwxa though. Though its a roborock vacuum, it makes you use an app called Mi Home. The app does not sync with alexa. It is a skill, but it will not find your device."
2.0 out of 5 stars,REQUIRES constant 2.4ghz wifi,It‚Äôs not compatible with a smart/mesh wifi where you connect to ‚Äúone wifi network‚Äù and it automatically jumps between 5ghz and 2.4ghz. So I only have a medium-noisy ‚Äòdumb‚Äô robot bouncing around and getting stuck under the kitchen cabinet doors.
5.0 out of 5 stars,One of the best purchases I have ever made.,Only negative thing I can say about this product is that I couldn't get it synced with the phone app
5.0 out of 5 stars,Make sure to clean out that filter when cycle is complete,Very happy with this product and has made my life so much easier. Does a great job of cleaning my wood floors.
4.0 out of 5 stars,Good value for the money,Used roborock to clean first floor -- took about 2 hours to complete -- did a good job -- not as good as if I had done it myself -- but the time savings made it worth it for sure
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great buy,Been wanting a vac for some time and got this one on Prime Day. Nice product and works pretty good with a small operator learning curve on making sure vac cleaning path is clear of cables and cords. Would buy again.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Super,Mejor de lo que esperamos.
4.0 out of 5 stars,Decent at cleaning.,"Great price and handled my aunties rugs and very basic Alexa features (on/off, that's it)"
1.0 out of 5 stars,Sent a filthy used product! BEWARE!,This arrived in used and dirty condition‚Ä¶repackaged and sent on to me. It had food and scuffs on the outside and hair tangled in the brushes. Disgusting and Ridiculous! Nasty!
5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth it,Used it for 2years and it still works as good as when I first got it. The app is 3/5 but the vacuum is 10/10
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for what I need,"only cleanings on hard surface and rugs. after getting a long haired cat we run this 3 times a weeks and I'm always amazed at how much ""Rosie"", thats what we call it, picks up. Great price too!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great device,UPDATE: They provided a software update that fixed the issue I was having .
5.0 out of 5 stars,"best of all , forgot other expensive brand","this one best best and so smart robot cleaner. quiter too. I own other expensive brand too, those much loud and there is no comparision to this. this oen clearly a winner.. thanks i bought and made my life easy.."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Easily cleans hardwoods like it‚Äôs nothing.,Very strong suction and very neat patterns for a bot without fancy lidar. The two gyroscopes combined with all the sensors makes this thing work very dependable. We‚Äôre very happy with the bot so far.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great value for the price.,"I really like this little guy. It does just as good of a job cleaning as the more expensive ones. It does work with Android devices/WIFI perfectly.

4.0 out of 5 stars,BEST BUDGET CLEAN ROBOT,I think it is the best robot if your budget under $300. Same functions as irobot around $450.
5.0 out of 5 stars,It works better than we expected,Works wonders. House has not been so clean. no dust bunnies under beds anymore. Works great cleaning up bird seeds from around our parrots cages
2.0 out of 5 stars,Suction is terrible,Suction is terrible I expected this to be much better. My cheap rumba does so much better than this one. Very disappointing considering it was four times expensive.
5.0 out of 5 stars,I only have the ROBO E4FOR A WEEK NOW and it really does a fantastic job on the rugs and floors,"Does a grate job cleaning the floors, has great features a great long running time , power, etc , my only concern, is getting parts for the Robot E4, Thank you, Joseph Santucci"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Addicted to Robot Vacuums,Nothing to complain about. It's a budget vacuum that amazes me. Works like a charm.
1.0 out of 5 stars,Awful gets stuck on carpet after 5min or less says error,Ughhhh so wish I would‚Äôve went with a different brand or a rumba again!!
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product,Wife loved it it works great
5.0 out of 5 stars,Works well for hard floors and carpet.,Dust tray is too small.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great robot vacuum,"This robot vacuum has plenty of suction and because of the excellent battery system, an easily vacuum my entire 1800 sqft condo without needing recharging. I highly recommend!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,Bumps the paint off the skirting boards,I am so sad. There were so many good reviews. Unfortunately it keeps stopping to clean without covering the entire area. Gets lost and most importantly destroying the paint on my walls. It is all over the it and looks terrible.
4.0 out of 5 stars,Missing parts,Came without all parts. Missing the mop cloth and moisture proof mat.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it,"I have a cat, it cleans all it's hair on the carpet, recommended!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Robisha gets the job done would recommend!,Love my little robot. Named her Robisha she does a great job for us!
3.0 out of 5 stars,Ok I guess,It is quiet. Cleaning the machine itself is very good. But it is not iRobot. It looks like it. I bought by mistake. But I got it exchanged fairly easily.
5.0 out of 5 stars,great for area rugs,"had to return another robot vacuum as the sweepers fell off after climbing over every area rug, this one is nice and can recognize the difference between carpet and hardwood, automatically increasing the suction"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Be patient with set up, codes are case sensitive",I don‚Äôt have to do the work
5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome little bot,"Our little machine, whom we call Bob, is the best thing that has happened to our family. He is smart, efficient, and persistent."
1.0 out of 5 stars,Returned,"Sent back, did not work properly."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Better than the others I've had by far,The best robot vacuum out there.
5.0 out of 5 stars,It works so far,Only had it since Christmas but it does a very good job!
5.0 out of 5 stars,Rosie to the rescue!!!‚ô•Ô∏è,Absolutely love everything about ‚ÄúRosie‚Äù lol I‚Äôve linked her with Alexa and downloaded the app to control her when I‚Äôm not home. She cleans up pet hair wonderfully!!!!
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Purchase,Skeptical at first but couldn‚Äôt be happier now. Picks up pet hair and cleans well under spaces would normally have to move to clean. Does an excellent job mapping showing what‚Äôs been cleaned. Dust bin could be larger but no other complaints. House stays cleaner than it did with us cleaning when we could
2.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed with the brand reputation for this model.,"Weak suction power on carpet, and always struggle to get onto carpet. Easily get stuck under low clearance space."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Works great on pet hair,Love this vacuum works great on my hard wood floors and ceramic tile. This has been a game changer at my home for keeping the floors clear of pet hair

5.0 out of 5 stars,should have gotten earlier,better than a wife
4.0 out of 5 stars,Great for pet hair,We had a Shark previously that did not hold up. So far we have loved the performance of this Vacuum. With a Husky in the house you need all the help you can get.
5.0 out of 5 stars,üëç,"Great product, yet not sure about the performance of the mopping function."
1.0 out of 5 stars,False advertising,Does not include all needed parts for function on hardwood floors. Buyer beware
5.0 out of 5 stars,Works ok,Very easy to install and start
5.0 out of 5 stars,Exactly what I was looking for!,"This is my first robot vacuum. I chose the Roborock for its reputation and reviews. I use it daily, sometimes twice a day due to dog hair and sand from our children (and us). This vacuum saves me so much time instead of me having to swiffer/sweep daily."
1.0 out of 5 stars,Never ever foolish yourself,"Total waste of time and money, keep cleaning same are and can‚Äôt even find the way to go back to dock. How come they fooling around people and make money doesn‚Äôt make sense to me."
2.0 out of 5 stars,Very lost,Would skip rooms and never able to find it's way to the base.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Excelente servicio al cliente,En espera de unos sensores nurvos defectuosos enviado por el equipo de soporte
5.0 out of 5 stars,Good Machine,It can find the dock when it's done........
3.0 out of 5 stars,Garbage WiFi,As a vacuum it‚Äôs fine but no matter how many times I try it will not connect to WiFi and the app is garbage. So if you just want to push the button and have it go around it‚Äôs fine
5.0 out of 5 stars,One of the best purchases I've ever made,If you own animals this is a must! Or even kids really. I have multi level floors and it is great! I only wish it would go on sale again so I can buy a second one for upstairs.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Makes cleaning easy!,Received this today and used it right away. Came almost fully charged. Easy to set up and to work it went! Did great picking up the dog hair which is the main reason I bought it. Had no trouble going from hardwood to carpet. I would highly recommend and it was a great price!
5.0 out of 5 stars,Very strong suction power,This is my second robot cleaner. I was not satisfied with the suction power of my first one. I've checked several ratings and decided to buy Roborock E4. I'm very much satisfied with it's power. I even found a board pin in the dust bin!
4.0 out of 5 stars,Great little vacuum,"This thing has not stopped finding dust, i thought my floors where clean before but this thing is absolutely amazing at getting every little thing and the app works great not sure about alexa though i just have it on a timer in the app"
5.0 out of 5 stars,This vacuum has good suction power and does a pretty good job for the price.,Suction power
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product,Loved it. It does its job.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Like it a lot,"It does its job, very satisficed."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Easy to use,"It‚Äôs been a week and I love this little vacuum! We have tile, laminate, and some low rugs and ‚ÄúRosa‚Äù takes care of it all. Easy set up, good-simple instructions, would buy again. My floors are so clean!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Powerful and quiet helper,A lot quieter than usual vacuum. Good to have one when daily vacuum is needed. Dust collection amount is unexpectedly large while the box was not too big. Suction power is strong enough to suck out powder from cracks and pick up paper shreds.
2.0 out of 5 stars,not connecting to wifi,"won‚Äôt connect to wifi, waited for hrs. still nothing, will be returning."
5.0 out of 5 stars,works great,very happy
5.0 out of 5 stars,this thing sucks.... LITERALLY,"this vacuum is awesome! has a good path , always finds the dock , and adjusts suction based on the type of floor surface. I would definitely recommend this to other folks... the vacuum has trouble connecting to my orbi network though."
4.0 out of 5 stars,Great overall for the price!,For the price it is a really good vacuum overall. At times it does run into things pretty hard. The manual control could be better. I have not tried the mop attachment but if I do I will update.
4.0 out of 5 stars,Works great for in between vacuums,"It picks up a good amount of dog hair but I still have to use the regular vacuum, just not as much."
1.0 out of 5 stars,Great functionality.  Does not sync with modern capabilities,This is a great product but because of the model does not sync with your home WiFi or the app to work with Alexa. Returned this item as it was a purchase for my 80+ Mom. She needs the capabilities of Alexa to start and stop the device
3.0 out of 5 stars,Alexa does not work with this since it uses MiHome app and you need Roborock app to use.,"I like the vacuum, but does not work with Alexa tried pairing 100 times with no success, seems like the app used is the issue. I have same issue with garage door opener has Amazon Key but won‚Äôt work with Alexa."
5.0 out of 5 stars,He is my best friend!!!,It‚Äôs the best !!!
2.0 out of 5 stars,Do not buy,It‚Äôs big and the mop sucks I only use the vacuum and threw the mop part away
5.0 out of 5 stars,Robot,Muy bueno y mantiene la casa bien limpia 100% recomendadoüëçüëçüëçüëç
2.0 out of 5 stars,It was a good..,Vacuum was working well but mop clothes kept flipping out and water was not coming out.
5.0 out of 5 stars,The vacuum is awesome. I later received the Mopping Module from the manufacturer.,The mopping module is just what I was hoping for and more. It cleans the areas very well and I am very satisfied with the performance. Thank the manufacturer with assisting me. They are courteous and very professional and definitely places the needs of the customer first
3.0 out of 5 stars,Good to have,Nice but it doesn‚Äôt cover entire area. The area near by my dustbin needs more cleaning but roborock never goes to that area. So I daily end up doing cleaning that area by remote control only . Which is seriously very frustrating.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent Robot Vacuum,"Start using it for one week, love it, work fantastic. I like how it runs over transitions and rugs easily. I have a cat, and this vacuum is quite effective at gathering pet hair. I think this is well worth the money."
3.0 out of 5 stars,The Roborocket worked fine but could not connect the my wifi for the MI Home App.,"The Roborocket worked fine but could not connect to my wifi for the MI Home App. I tried for hours to connect, researching every tutorial I could find on the internet for help. I am returning the device. So disappointed."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Threshold Clearing,"I have 0.5"" thresholds in my household and even though it says the Roborock is able to clear up to 0.8""-inch thresholds, it can not clear even simple 0.5"" thresholds. I have no clue how or why it says that it is rated to be able to climb like that."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"Not new, no charging station nor paperwork!",I ordered ‚Äúnew‚Äù and this is what I received! It is used and did not include a charging station nor any paperwork.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Best mid-range robot vacuum.,"Without the lidar in more expensive models, this is as good as budget friendly robot vacuums can possibly get. Great value, would recommend."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I love it,"It‚Äôs amazing, super powerful, I‚Äôm honestly surprised that people pay so much for the roomba but this thing is so good for a fraction of the price!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Couldn't be happier with performance!,Does an amazing job on our carpet and hardwood floors.
5.0 out of 5 stars,The best appliance I have,If I had to choose between this and my dishwasher it would be this vacuum!
2.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed,The Roomba is able to get under furniture better. This gets stuck under furniture all the time.
2.0 out of 5 stars,"Mapping technology in the S5 is well worth it, don‚Äôt buy the E4!","Spend the extra money for the S5 so that you can map your house yourself. This thing has spent more than an hour in one open concept room in my house. It also constantly spits out ‚ÄúError 8, remove any obstacles‚Äù when it is in the middle of the room. Worthless."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"At this price, why not?","The first time we started this thing and let it go we knew we made the right decision. whether it was our white tile floor or our carpet, this little Roborock rocks!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Ready to go out of the box.,"Extremely easy to use. Just empty the bin regulary and clean the brushes occasionally, and let it take of the rest."
4.0 out of 5 stars,Decent for the price,Cleans a little erratic and has its quirks. But at its price point is pretty decent.
3.0 out of 5 stars,Does not work I. Shag Carpet,This is a good product. But it does not work on Shag Carper

2.0 out of 5 stars,Buyer Beware,"I‚Äôve had the vacuum for about 7 months. Since the beginning have had connection issue but I. The 1st couple weeks their customer service responded to my issues and fixed my problems. I‚Äôve recently sent them request for assistance because the unit will not connect to the internet thus I cannot access the vacuum through the app and adjust any setting on the vacuum. I continue to get NO response from this company. The mop feature on the vacuum is worthless. It does nothing and is not worth any extra money. The vacuum itself does clean the floor well but does get stuck or confused where I have to reorientate/move the unit which becomes extremely annoying. I turn it on (and I have to do it by pressing a button on the machine since like I said it will not connect to the internet) and go to the store and when I get home, expecting a clean floor, only to discover the vacuum got itself stuck somewhere. I‚Äôve cleaned the vacuum throughly on a regular basis and do all the recommend maintenance to the machine but still have issues. I‚Äôve also reset the machine several times trying to fix the connection issue but nothing works."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"Constant Error Messages, Slowed Down After about 6 Months of Use","We were excited to see this at such a low price last November (2020), which is about half what it's listed for currently. I would never pay almost 300 bucks for this device, though. For that, you would be better off with one of the big brand names. After using the robot vacuum two times per week for about 6 months on the bottom floor of our house‚Äîwhich is about 900sqft, half low-pile carpet and half brick. The brick area does not get cleaned nearly as well by the Roborock E4 as it does on rugs)‚ÄîI get a notification through the app within five minutes that the strainer is blocked/filter is wet. We've kept the device clean, washed the filter and let it dry for a couple of days before putting back in, and wiped off the bottom, as well as removed any debris or hair from the brushes frequently. But I have to empty the dustbin and knock out the filter about 4-5 times per use while it continues to tell me something is wrong."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Customer Center is very, very helpful.","Our roborock is named Ibby( I‚Äôll be back)I love having him! He goes where I have an upright vacuum that cannot go. I can control him from my phone, I can set him to work from the hairdressers."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"All you working moms, give yourself a break from the vacuum!","I have three dogs and a newborn, so vacuuming daily or every other day was my part of my routine. For my birthday, I really wanted to try a robovac but they are a little pricey. I saw this one on an Amazon flash sale and asked for it for my birthday. (And my fianc√© bought it, YAY)"
5.0 out of 5 stars,5 stars for the price,"This was a Christmas present and probably my favorite ever! I will start by saying I have messy little kids and very hairy dogs so it had it work cut out for it. It did a pretty awesome just both upstairs and down and I believe it is by far the best you can get in the price range. It did well on my carpet as long as it was kept up with, otherwise it required a second pass, and did amazing on my tile. It is really good about getting out of tight spaces and working around to get EVERYTHING. It could not climb up on my high pile rug, but that was to be expected. The vacuum is great, and I couldn't believe how much it picked up even when it was run every day ü§¢. That being said I did end up returning it to upgrade to the S4 max because I wanted the ability to have it avoid certain areas and map out rooms. Overall if you don't need smart maping functions and the advanced control features this is an awesome little vaccum with a pretty good sized dust bin!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,I‚Äôm obsessed,"This little guy is amazing. The navigation is so much smarter than the previous generations of robot vacuums. The mopping function is amazing if you do it every day or every other day. Otherwise there‚Äôs too much dirt/dust for a good clean. The instructions say to use only water, no cleaning products. So I spray a little bit on the floor before setting this guy loose and that does it. My house has never felt so clean, I love love love this thing."
3.0 out of 5 stars,Works great (when it works),"The suction power, bin capacity, and coverage of this vacuum are actually impressive. The problem is that it consistently loses the wifi signal and needs to be factory reset in order to do anything. Once reset, it will work for between 1 and 3 days and then - nothing. And I'm talking in the middle of cleaning this will happen. Then, have to factory reset, set up wifi, and redo any timers or schedules that you want to set. The stupid thing won't even charge if it loses the wifi. It has previously returned to the dock to charge, lost its wifi connection, and sat on the dock for days without actually charging. Then when I go to reset it, have to fully charge before it can clean."
5.0 out of 5 stars,excellent value,"After doing hours of research on the best robot vacuum under $300 my partner and I decided on this one. We named him Owen and he has not disappointed. We live in a one bedroom with some carpeting and a cat who both sheds a lot and drags litter pellets everywhere. This vacuum has made it excessively easy to stay on top of cleaning. It holds a surprisingly large amount in the dustbin and the battery life is great. The fact that it goes in a predictable pattern is really nice, and there is even a joystick feature on the app where you can tell it where to go. Sometimes if something is in it's way it will skip a room, but this is easily remedied by clearing the path and restarting the vacuum. Only downside is that our cat is still mortified every time we turn him on."
3.0 out of 5 stars,Just trying to use it,We got it as a Christmas present to outselves. We are trying to use it now and it won‚Äôt set the App up to use it. Have a few hrs of trying many different things I started reading about the App. The App has bad reviews and most negative. We will next call but if that doesn‚Äôt do it we will return. The bad thing about returning is got it on sale day before Christmas. It was on sale so if I wanted to exchange nothing is on sale now.
5.0 out of 5 stars,This is very reliable and just all around really great.,"I have had a version of this Roborock vacuum for about a year and a half, use it sometimes every day."
3.0 out of 5 stars,Great in comparison to my other robovac but...,"I cannot get this to connect to my internet for the life of me. I would like to get it integrated into the app but no matter how close I am to my router it says ""bring device closer to router"" and times out when it's trying to get connected. If someone has found a solution to this that would be great!"
2.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn‚Äôt work like it claims to.,This automatic floor cleaner machine gets stuck on everything. It fills up so fast and doesn‚Äôt pick up the bare minimal on hard floors. One little hair ball and it‚Äôs full. I would of been better off sticking with a broom.
4.0 out of 5 stars,"A little dumb, but gets the job done","I went in thinking that the navigation for this unit would be a little bit better as, it has trouble finding its home and sometimes cleans over one room multiple times while not going down a hallway to get to other rooms (without giving it an hour to do so), but the suction power and cleaning capability are bar none. Just don't expect this to rival the smart mapping of the S6."
1.0 out of 5 stars,poor navigation,"After going through about a quarter of a relatively featureless room, this machine stopped with ""remove obstacle"" error. This has been repeated throughout several tests I did in two different rooms. I also did not find its way back home properly when it stopped cleaning due to low-battery. Very disappointed about the quality of navigation, which is critical for any robot cleaner."
5.0 out of 5 stars,It works exceptionally well.  Love it!,We have two dogs. No more tuff's of fur anywhere!
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great!,"Bought this as a housewarming gift for son and his wife. They have dark wood floors so need this vacuum on a daily basis. They love it, can't stop raving about it."
2.0 out of 5 stars,Unreliable,"Worked fine for two months, then it became erratic in performance. Would not recommend."
1.0 out of 5 stars,Terrible,It gets confused. I find it going back and forth in circles. Doesn't clean up against walls. Misses Alot of spots. It needs another side attachment to get dirt on other side of unit. One side attachment doesn't cut it. Buy something else.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this robovac,"My only complaint - the vac cannot find its way back to the dock. Otherwise, love the little guy. Seriously consider if you have dogs."
1.0 out of 5 stars,Just terrible,Terrible company Terrible customer service Terrible product .
5.0 out of 5 stars,Love the Robo,I got this for Christmas and it‚Äôs absolutely changed my
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great value,The performance for the price is a great deal. Vacuum is solid and dependable.
4.0 out of 5 stars,Bad customer service,Vacuum was great when it was working. My dock stopped charging the vacuum so I contacted the company. They wouldn‚Äôt do anything about it and wanted to charge me $120 to ‚Äúrepair‚Äù my vacuum. Oh well I‚Äôd rather go a different brand.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Reliable,My Robby is meticulous and very thorough. He reaches all nicks and crannies without assistance. He stays on course and does not get stuck or deviate from his goal. My bare feet are loving the clean surface throughout my house. Best invention ever!!!

5.0 out of 5 stars,Great machine,"Love our ""rosie"" she cleans well and is quick. Would buy again!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Quality,"Excellent , I am so happy"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Has almost totally taken over all vacuuming in our house!,"¬†Wow have robot vacuums come way down in price and way up in features. I have used some of the ""dumber"" random bounce navigation robot vacs in the past and those work fine in smaller areas but if you want multiple rooms cleaned, they just don't cut it. Because of their random nature they are way more inefficient and usually unable to get back to the dock to charge. But this Roborock E4 is amazing. The fact that it can map out where it has been means it knows where the dock is and how to get back to it. This alone is what sets it apart from other vacs in this price range. Also, because of the way it maps it can clean in a much more structured way like a human would. It systematically goes back and forth making it's way across the room getting every inch. Even when it doesn't seem to finish one room before it moves onto another don't worry because it will get back to it before it considers itself ""done"". It also appears to do a perimeter pass as a final step to make sure it's gotten everything. How do I know? When it's done you can see the cleaning history and view a map of what it cleaned. It's crazy that they are able to have it work like this on a vac w/o laser navigation and at this price point. The only thing it can't do that the higher model one‚Äôs w/laser nav can do is setup ""no-go"" zones. It supposedly has Alexa support, but I couldn't test that as I have an all Google house. Google assistant is not supported at this time but hoping it will be at some point as some of their other products do. I also have an E3 and I would say the claims of it being 10% faster and more efficient are true. The app is also easy to use. It comes with a moping attachment that you fill with water and connect to the vac. It will then mop as it vacuums. The only issue with this is if you have rugs that you don‚Äôt want if mopping over you can‚Äôt stop it from going over those because it does not have the no-go zone feature of more expensive robo vacs. The dustbin is huge for robo vac standards and the brush never seems to get anything tangled in it. The suction is also really strong. Overall, for the price this thig is amazing. Because it can plan it‚Äôs path and then find it‚Äôs way back to the dock to charge it is head and shoulders better than the random navigation vacs normally in this price range. Definitely worth it!"
3.0 out of 5 stars,"Not Quite to the level of a ""Smart"" Vacuum",We have been using Eufy 11s vacuums at two different locations for a few years. The Eufy 11s vacuums proved to be good vacuums with strong suction but they don't have navigation and basically bounce around the rooms randomly until they run out of battery power and then they find the charging station to recharge. This method works but some areas are cleaned too much and others are sometimes missed.
4.0 out of 5 stars,Roomba 675 and Roborock E4 Comparison! Roborock wins hands down!!,"Not bad overall! Both are in the same price range. The Roomba 675 pros: good quality, well packaged, great on carpets due to the dual brush design, easy to clean, very user friendly app, and it easily got over my doorway saddles which are about 3/4 in high. Cons: Its quite loud if its on hardwood, on carpets its fine. Very poor suction on hard surfaces, but it does eventually get the job done just takes a bunch of passes. Doesn't clean as efficiently in a pattern as the Roborock, it just bounces around. If it gets accidentally bumped while charging, it doesn't return to station as easily and quietly as the E4 does. Battery life much lower compared to the Roborock E4 about 2x. In conclusion its really not a bad robovac. I managed to get the Roborock E4 on sale off amazon for $180 and it performed better than the Roomba in my opinion. The roborock does feel a bit cheaper in quality but not by much. The app is a bit harder to use, but it has 3x the suction and nearly 2x the battery life. Also, due to the gyroscope built in, it actually cleans more efficiently in a pattern, rather than just random bumping around. In conclusion I stuck with the Roborock E4 and returned the Roomba 675. But if you have alot of carpeting, the Roomba 675 wouldn't be a bad choice. Hope this helped if you are in between those two."
5.0 out of 5 stars,You Need One!,"I love this little guy! I‚Äôm so happy I finally caved and got one for myself. I have six animals - 2 dogs, 4 cats and felt like I was constantly sweeping the dang floors. I have some degenerative disc issues that prevent this from being something I‚Äôd like to do often as it needs doing (relatively pain free, anyway). Now, I just run this little dude when I get home from work. I‚Äôve used a Roomba brand at my office and can say this one is way smarter, had better suction and a larger dustbin."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great vacuum!,"I bought 2 of the E4 robots to replace an ""uncoordinated"" Deebot, which drove me insane, as there was no cleaning pattern."
1.0 out of 5 stars,Awful,"I got this and used it once. It‚Äôs on the dock and won‚Äôt charge now. It‚Äôs literally unusable. This is the worst thing I‚Äôve purchased off Amazon in some time. Completely disappointed. Also, messages their support and no one has responded at all."
3.0 out of 5 stars,I like it but it has cons,"So I have had this vacuum for a good 9 months now and I never gave it a review but I decided now is the time I give one, first off, this vacuum does go on a random track instead of what is advertised, I have to pick it up just to get it to get the other side of my living room which isn‚Äôt even big but then it misses things because it doesn‚Äôt clean in that ‚ÄúS‚Äù pattern like it says because for some reason mine vacuums in a random pattern. Then I always get the filter warning of it being wet or needs to be cleaned literally after I have already cleaned it. And it also gives me an error that there are objects in the way when there isn‚Äôt even anything around the vacuum. I do still really like this vacuum as it was relatively inexpensive for what it does and what‚Äôs on the market and I like that I don‚Äôt have to vacuum myself which I hate doing! But I do find some cons in it which is why I won‚Äôt give it 5 stars. I also bought the mop attachment which literally says not to use cleaner in the mop canister or it could ruin the plastic so I don‚Äôt know how effective it is at cleaning (I spray my floors with cleaner now because of that warning)"
1.0 out of 5 stars,Complete waste of my time,"I can only comment on the installation and setup of this item, which sucked. It may be a perfectly good vacuum, as several other reviewers say. Unfortunately, I never got that far despite spending an entire afternoon trying to get my Roborock E4 working."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great performance with plenty of battery power,"I am very happy with the performance of my Roborock vacuum. This unit is a vast improvement over my previous robot vacuum ‚Äì one that ping-ponged around the room and would only last 45 minutes before depleting the battery. I returned that other robot vacuum and purchased the Roborock vacuum for not much more money. The Roborock cleans each room in a predictable back and forth pattern, with more than enough power to clean each area of my home ‚Äì even after an hour of cleaning, the unit still had about 50% battery remaining. It also does a much better job of cleaning up the long hair from my girlfriend than my previous unit. I clean the filter after each use (about twice a week, sometimes more) although could go longer between cleanings."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"AMAZING SUCTION, BATTERY LIFE & PATTERN MEMORY!!",¬†I wish this Lil vac came with a separate remote control. But that's my only wish for this Lil vac.
1.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth the price for lasting so little,"So I have a E4 and a E25 from roborock. After my robot dying in the middle of my room everyday for a few days, without going back to the dock to charge, I decided to contact customer service. They said it was very likely either the motherboard or battery with an estimated of $120 cost for the repair and it was out of warranty (only for 1 year and it‚Äôs been a little over 2). So really. I understand it is an estimate but either way. I‚Äôm not only upset about the fact that in less than 3 years the unit is already malfunctioning almost to the point it‚Äôs useless and should be thrown in the trash, but that I would have to pay for the cost of repair. Finally, if that isnt enough, the estimated price for repair is almost like buying a new unit. And by the way, I have an ILife as well and when I had to replace the motherboard, they covered all the costs of repair with a fantastic customer service help even though it was way past the warranty time - guess why? It shouldn‚Äôt be acting that way already and they admitted."
3.0 out of 5 stars,Decent vacuum but mop function disappointing,¬†This is a decent vacuum but I expected more from the mopping option. Here are the pros and cons
4.0 out of 5 stars,Decent little robot vac,This is so far a great robot vac for the price range. I had no issues connecting to my phone or wifi. It can sometimes get stuck under the fridge door or the edge of my couch but I run it while I'm at home since I have pets and have heard horror stories of robot vacs dragging pet accidents around the house. I do run it daily and have to empty the bin about every 4-7 days. The battery never gets too low and it cleans approx 67m2 in about 80min or less. It does sometimes get what I think is lost but I do move things around so it could just be the software remapping the area. Would recommend this vaccum.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent Alternative to Others,"I love this vacuum. I have only had it about a week, but I really do love it. It keeps my hardwood & stone floors clean. I purchased it because my wood/stone floors show so much more dirt and grime than my upstairs carpet. I really needed something to tide me over between vacuums. This did the trick. It took about 3 times for the mapping to actually map all the different rooms, but once it did, it easily navigates all the areas in my house. It ever learned to go between and under the bar stools at by breakfast bar rather than just around them. The suction is good and cleans everything very well. I just now purchased the separate water tank and mop cloths and will update the review once I use them. The app is good. The remote doesn't work very well, so I just let it clean using the automated mapping. It is an excellent value over more expensive brands and a great beginner robot vacuum."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for regular use,"Bought this vacuum cleaner few months back and waited to write the review. I really love it as it cleans well and reaches place where regular vacuum can't. I can use this regularly any time without exhausting myself, that's for me is value of money. That being said I do not have kids or pets, so I can't tell if it's effective for them. I use it mostly on alternate days and that keeps my apartment clean. I love how I don't have to worry about switching modes from carpet to hardwood or vice-versa. I don't think using it regularly made any changes to my electricity bill. So all good stuff."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"Carl, the Dumbot","For the price I paid, this is a decent little vacuum. I just wish it wasnt so dumb. His name is Carl. And while he has become a part of our family, Carl is very special. He does clean well when he isn't stuck. And there is the problem. If there is a place he gets stuck, you can move him to the other end of the house and before you know it he has migrated right back to that spot. When his wheels become suspended, or he gets under furniture, he doesn't go the other way. He will try and try again like the little robot that could...Except that he can't."
2.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed. Not for pet hair.,"I am so disappointed. Day 1, I was excited and optimistic. Now it's day 5, and I'm regretting throwing the box away so soon because now I don't know how to return this piece of junk."
1.0 out of 5 stars,Takes 7 hours to vacuum one room,"¬†I‚Äôm an experienced robot vacuum owner. My previous one quit working after 7 years and is no longer available. I believed the ratings of this one and took a chance. If I had not been caring for a family member this would have been returned in the allowed time frame. The purpose of a robot vacuum is to vacuum. Period. I can vacuum faster but I desired a device that could complete the task while I was elsewhere in the house. The video shows the vacuum in my front room that has a clear area. The half of the room to the right that has been vacuumed took 90 minutes. Yes, an hour and a half. I took the video 49 minutes ago and it has cleaned about another foot. Yesterday, on a full charge, it took 7 hours to vacuum the master bedroom. As an experienced owner, I knew to have things picked up and moved out of the way. I have no idea why this highly rated device is disfunctional. I‚Äôll keep looking on Woot or eBay for someone to sell the old Neato model that I had."
2.0 out of 5 stars,Amazingly Displeased,updated one additional star 1/24/21: the suction is great and it has an extra large collection bin. still other things disappointing remain as below.
5.0 out of 5 stars,You won't believe what's in your carpet!,"So yuck! This definitely pulls out stuff you don't know is there!. The image above was just after a very short run of less than 5 minutes. I had it running at max suction. I have 2 dogs and questioned if they would be unsettled by this robot but they pay no attention to it. Even on max suction it run pretty quietly. Now it does seem to get a bit confused when returning to the dock, but maybe that I moved it while it was running. You can see the lines where is has ran on the carpet just like when you use a regular vacuum. I would have to say I'm delighted with this purchase should help to keep the dog hair down between regular vacuuming. It was easy to set up on wifi and is easily controlled through the app. I would definitely recommend this to anyone interested in a robot vacuum."
2.0 out of 5 stars,Lost and confused,"I loved the suction and how much dirt and dog hair this unit picked up. (I have husky's so there is A LOT of hair) However, this unit was always confused and never could figure out which way to go. More often than not, I would find the bot cleaning the same 2 ft section over and over and over and over again, humping the wall or showing an error because it thinks there is something blocking its path (when there was NOTHING around). I literally would have to restart the unit 20 times (using the app - which was handy) until the battery would eventually need to be recharged. Also, the poor little bot could never find its way back to the dock. I used this unit for two full weeks hoping it would figure out its new home.....but nope. Only 1 time did it find its own way home. (Even a blind squirrel finds a nut once in a while) I have medium pile carpet and perhaps that was part of the problem. It seemed to do okay on my kitchen tile. It never stayed in my kitchen though.....It would always b-line for the living room just to work in a small random section of carpet. As badly as I wanted this to work......little bot is going back."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it! Makes a mom's job a little easier!,I've only had this vacuum for a few days (about a week) and I love it. I had a shark robot previously that I disliked but this one is great! It's so quiet and changes suction between carpet and tile. It takes a little bit for it to get it's pattern down but it does eventually. We probably have too many things in the way which is most likely the reason for that.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed said it would work with Alexa but it does not.,Works nice but does not do what I expected it to do I wanted something that would interact with Alexa and it doesn‚Äôt it does hook up to my phone with an app but as I said it does not work with Alexa as they said thinking about sending it back it does come with the mop attachment have not used them yet but as I said I am very disappointed in this.
5.0 out of 5 stars,It works!  I would buy this one again.,"NO issues with function. Cleans way better than me.... Dust bin is hard to empty and fills fast. To empty, you need to pull a filter out and there's no easy way to grasp the filter to remove it. All of these types of things have small dust bins, but at least make them easier to empty then."
4.0 out of 5 stars,Had trouble pairing it to phone,"I have yet been able to pair this vacuum to my phone. I even moved it right next to the wifi and it still doesn‚Äôt connect. I tried different areas in my house, I tried googling what to do and nothing. So right now I just turn the vacuum on and it vacuums whatever it wants. It also bumps against everything and got very scratched up on the first use, so I doubt I can even return it."
4.0 out of 5 stars,I'd buy it again.,"This is the 4th or 5th brand I have tried and it works the best. It sits higher than most so it can't go under some furniture and gets wedged from time to time, but it runs on the schedule I set and eventually finds the charging station. I sometimes have to tell it to start the clean cycle again because it will think it is done cleaning way to early. With the app, I can control it remotely and getting status notifications is nice."
1.0 out of 5 stars,Works well until something goes wrong,"Our first few cleaning sessions with this robot vacuum were promising. It handled hardwood floors, tiles, and a low-pile rug easily, and apart from some issues with the app (especially the necessary permissions), we were happy with its cleaning abilities and overall usability."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Does the job really well.,"I have an S6 pure as well as this E4 and am very impressed with its abilities. Even though it does not have the lidar, it does work like a vacuum with one. The mapping is very efficient and does not go over places more than once. Its very thorough and picks up everything from the floor. It returns the map of the area it cleaned right after the cleaning cycle. The cleaning time is also almost close to the lidar models(may be about 10% longer). The battery life is also great. Overall I highly recommend this vaccum. Its a great deal for the price."
1.0 out of 5 stars,Very Little Support,"I have to start out by saying mine came in the mail damaged. The front was all scratched up and when I tried to use it, it would just go in circles instead of the zig-zag patter it is supposed to go to complete the room cleaning. I was upset with that right off the bat. I contacted customer service and they told me there was nothing they could do for me. The reasoning they gave me for this was because my rugs were too thick apparently. In the description of the item it said that the vacuum does well with medium pile rugs, which is what I have and the reason I went with this vacuum. They told me, if I wanted to use it in specific areas in my house just to download the app and map out where you want the vacuum to go. Alright, I thought at least I would still be able to use it. But, once I downloaded the app and started it up... I found out that the app no longer supports this vacuum anymore. I tried reaching out to customer service again with no response. Now, I have a 10 lbs paperweight. Not impressed."
4.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect Vaccum with only one issue....,"Let me start by saying that for its price, this is an amazin vaccum, it cleans good, it mops good, and it does keep the place clean. The only problem i had with it is that the cliff sensors would trigger when in seeing a dark or black pattern in the carpet, i thought the vaccum was bad in the beggining due to it always being stuck in the middle of the carpet due to the black patters, but once i seperated the black carpet from its path, the roborock did shine cleaning in intelligent patterns not missing a spot and mopping the floors clean (although you would have to buy the mopping module seperately). I think if you have a carpet with dark or black patters that you would want the roborock to clean, then maybe you should look elsewhere, but if you have light colored carpets or none at all then this roborock is the best in this price range. Oh and also the roborock does not get tangled with hairs, but it does get tangled with small wires so keep that in mind! Overall i recommend this vaccum and i don't regret the purchase!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Value Great Vacuum,"This is my first robot vacuum and I'm glad we bought this one. It's a lower model but is great. It has powerful suction power and transfers from my wood floor to carpet with no problem. It does my 1st level in 2 cleanings. Once the battery gets to 20% it goes to the charger to recharge and finishes. I haven't figured out its mapping but it does repeat areas that it's already vacuum on the 2nd pass but it does vacuum all areas. One set back is that on my carpet in the basement , which is a little thicker it does seem to have trouble and complains that objects are in its way when it's in the middle of the floor. Yet and still great vacuum!"
2.0 out of 5 stars,Decent Product with one Issue,The product is good and initially i was impressed with the same.
5.0 out of 5 stars,I love him,I love my new robot. He cleans my house and doesn‚Äôt complain! The only weird part was the app. You have to agree in the terms of service not to disrupt the social order of Chinese society to use the app. So...that‚Äôs something
5.0 out of 5 stars,All I need...,This vacuum cleans my entire 1300 foot small home in under 90 minutes. Has not gotten stuck yet and always finds its way home. The bin fills up completely. Cleaned under my bed which hasn't seen a vacuum in years. Finds every room and remembers. Wish it was a little quieter however. Scheduling is easy with the app.
1.0 out of 5 stars,Did not work right out of the box,"I was so excited to try this robot vacuum. I charge it up and it worked great for 60 seconds. First error. I reset it as the instructions said and it worked for 30 seconds before the same error happened again. I did this off and on for an hour. After doing some research, it seems it's a problem. I am packing it up and sending it back."
5.0 out of 5 stars,cleans well,"does not map so is most useful if your home is wide open and you'd clean it all at the same time. Can close bedroom doors if you don't want it in there. Love that it does not bounce around hitting things to change directions, just keeps going back and forth and you can see where it's been."
1.0 out of 5 stars,No edge work,"It didn‚Äôt get anything within 4‚Äù of the wall. Nothing under the couch edges or counter edges was touched. It turned around in the middle of the room for no reason and skipped half of each room. And out of 9 rooms in my house it only went into 4. Someone help me, I want this to work."
3.0 out of 5 stars,Wifi issues,All of the these chinese robo vacs dont want to play nice with wifi. This vac seems to he no different. Either the app cannot see the vacuum or the vacuum cant see the wifi router. It is always a problem. Going to return this one and get another roomba. You get what you pay fot i guess.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Wow. Better than Roomba,Very happy with this purchase. We have two roombas and this one beats them both in terms of battery life suction power and ability to clean. what I don't like about the Roomba especially not the high-end model ones are that they're very random and they're cleaning algorithm. And this particular robo Rock has the same cleaning method as the higher end ones like the six Max but for less than half the price.
2.0 out of 5 stars,Very bad robot vac.,"Well I just started using the Roborock E4 and it has shut down around 10 times for no apparent reason. I've tried a couple Roombas, never experienced that, forno reason anyways. Probably will be sending it back unless it gets considerably better over the next week. It never leaves a very small area also, like 10 square feet. Pretty bad!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Robot Vacuum!,"Really great little vacuum! I didn‚Äôt know the vacuums spoke lol so this one does and announces the things it does. I even linked it with Alexa and had Alexa start the vacuuming process. It cleaned our downstairs which isn‚Äôt very big, in about 40 minutes and mapped out the whole area. Thought it was pretty cool! Suction is great! Dustbin is easy to empty and the Mi Home app is very useful. I can also buy the optional mop attachment too! Really great value and was lucky to score this on an Amazon deal!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,Unable to connect to Google WiFi,I haven't been able to use this device as it will NOT connect to my Google WiFi network. I will likely be returning the product and I am very disappointed.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for dog hair and carpet!,We have mostly carpet in our home and have been running it every day. It sucks dirt and dog hair up from carpet super well! Love this thing. Wish you could have different rooms so it knew where to go when I bring it to another floor.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"We love this vacuum, so we bought 2","This is the second vacuum we have bought for our house. Our first one was for our main floor and we loved it, so much we bought a second one for our basement. You can't go wrong with this guy right here."
5.0 out of 5 stars,We're in love with this vacuum,"We use this guy at least twice a week, and it keeps our floors outstandingly clean. Highly recommend it. The only critic I have is that there seems to be a glitch with it's software that doesn't allow it to connect to Androids. However, that issue doesn't bother me so much so as to take one star away from it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,It‚Äôs just amazing,"I‚Äôm just in love with this vacuum! First of all it‚Äôs very intelligent, I‚Äôd say, because it really knows which parts of the floor are still duty. Second, the suction power is very impressive, even though I haven‚Äôt used the max power. Also the noise level is very decent and the remote control is very easy to use. Finally, I think it really worth to buy the water tank to mop."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product,"didn't buy a robot before, this one is amazing, it did its job perfectly. I use this thing every day to clean my house when I went to gym. Lol I think maybe I should bought the one with a mop. Anyway it‚Äôs really good!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,worth money,"I bought the vacuum for my sister since she is super busy with work and can‚Äôt find the time to vacuum the house. She says that it is awesome and does the job and leaves the house spotless, she enjoyed it so much she even bought another one to make it faster. Highly recommend"
3.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointing,This vacuum has been a major let down. I spent a long time reading reviews for different robot vacuums and deciding which to get. I finally settled on this. The suction is terrible and the vacuum is so slow. It can‚Äôt seem to remember the path. Disappointed.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Really good robot vacuum!!,"Awesome robot vacuum!!! I love it!! Just got stocked once but no big deal, definitely recommend this product to whoever want good quality without paying to much, way much better than other brands in the same price range, not even roborock"
5.0 out of 5 stars,my best house helper,I fell in love!!!
1.0 out of 5 stars,Very poor product,"We purchased this as a 2nd Roborock vacuum for our game room. Very disappointed because the S4 model was great. This vacuum was difficult to pair, is controlled via a differenr app than our S4 model even though it is the same exact manufacturer and does not vacuum very well. Very disappointed in this model but highly recommend the S4 model."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing Robot Vacuum!!,¬†This is our first purchase of a robot vacuum and we are so happy with it! It truly does an amazing job of cleaning. We have four little dogs in the house and the dog hair was such a pain to clean up daily. We just set the vacuum on a schedule to clean nightly and it‚Äôs spotless! The compartment is large and the battery life is long. I can‚Äôt say enough good things about it. I‚Äôm so in love!! üòç
4.0 out of 5 stars,Just ok,Seems to get confused and lose its way a lot. Its also left black streaks on all my trim around my entire new home. I haven‚Äôt been able to get the scuff marks off either. Not happy!

I'm in love I didn't know if I wold like it I really thought I would have to return it with 2 inside dogs a baby and 3 guys tracking dirt inside all day long but it takes care of it like a boss. I didn't know until I received it and was setting it up that it has a mopping attachment you can order i am definitely ordering that!!!!

2.0 out of 5 stars,Not very smart,"This is a good vacuum but a poor automated machine. I am not sure if this robot is actually using SLAM or what, because it is constantly getting lost, returning to the same areas, and can't find it's home dock."

1.0 out of 5 stars,Misleading product photos,"I had purchased a Roborock S6 and have used it for about a year and love it. I bought the E4 to have upstairs to replace my Samsung vacuum. The pictures are misleading in multiple photos it shows the E4 vacuum with the app, in the app you see a map of the house. This is what I was needing as I do not need to vacuum our guest room every day. Unfortunately the E4 does not have a map, and will only vacuum the entire area that it has access to. Then without the map, I cannot perform a single room cleaning if needed. This is very disappointing @Roborock."
1.0 out of 5 stars,Error 8 Right out the box!,Suction seems amazing but I continue to get error 8 message that says something's blocking it when nothing is. I checked the wheels and the sensors nothing works.
1.0 out of 5 stars,Constant error codes,Used twice and got error code 8 both times when unit was in the middle of an open room. It also spent about 20 minutes searching in the same spot in the living room. Returning it for a different brand.
1.0 out of 5 stars,Buyers be aware,I got a very dirty used machine.
3.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth it,"Had this for two months and has slowly been getting LOUDER to the point where you can barely have a conversation with it on..even on the quiet mode. Runs into everything so much worse than my Roomba ever did. Also battery lasts maybe 30 minutes at my house (tile floors). I hate the app it is not user friendly, can‚Äôt ‚Äúfind‚Äù the robot if it gets lost, and no notifications."

4.0 out of 5 stars,A great buy for a lower price,"Second robot vac, started off with the DEEBOT 900 series, which has fared me well. That vac was always a nightmare to pair with wifi, and generally was a bit aggressive with cords and stuff, although it's a workhorse and was worth what I invested."
5.0 out of 5 stars,very clean,"Its cleaning effect is very good, especially on carpets. It can be cleaned very clean. It is easy to use, and it can be used when the phone is connected. The noise is not too loud. I use about 3~4 times to replace the garbage"
5.0 out of 5 stars,I'm pleased,"Does exactly what it's supposed to do. It does seem to get to the whole house in about 2 to 3 hours. I like that I get alerted if there is an issue, like full dust bin or hair wrapped around the beater. I am only running it about once a week. I have areas that need daily vacuuming, but since the robot won't go directly to that area, I just sweep by hand. Rather than having it run for 2 hours before it gets to the one area that needs attention."
4.0 out of 5 stars,Makes my life easier,"This is my first robot vacuum, and I've been really happy with it overall! It works great in our house (1800 sq feet, no carpet, no pets). We tend to run it around the whole house once a week, and it cleans well enough that I don't run our upright vacuum at all except for our area rug. I genuinely feel like the robot vacuum makes my life easier."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Best vacunn robot ever!!!,It cleans in a very organized and efficiency way! Suction power and deep cleaning are really good. I have 2 of this machines already!!!
